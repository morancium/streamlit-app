The semicircular shape is created by defining the lower limit and upper limit, using functions like sum, min, max, count. Within that scale, we can create various color ranges in thresholds to classify the data.We can make the pointer to indicate the sum/ avg/ min/ max/ count/  first/ last values of the metric over the semicircular shape. Thresholds can also be created on the pointer.InputsMetrics: 1 or more metricsAttributes: 1 attribute.Use as Filter Option - Not AvailableAxesYou can add a title in Angular gauge chart and can do text formattings to the title. User can do labels formattings too in the Axes property tab.From the 4.5 version of Vitara Charts, the new features added to the Gauge chart where there are some implementations in the Gauge property editor.Now, we have Dial, Gauge and Grid Line properties in the Gauge property.GaugeUsers can see the pointer at any aggregation level of metrics with start and end values. We can apply Start and End angles for the gauge from the 4.5 version of Vitara charts.Below is the example of the Cost metric shown with Avg aggregation with start value as 'First' aggregation and end value as 'Last' aggregation. The 'Start' angle is 30 degrees and the 'End' angle is 200 degrees.Dial and Grid LineWe can now see the pointer (Current Value) at any aggregation level of metrics with the start and end values.From the 4.5 version of Vitara charts, the dial properties are introduced. Dial's color, dial's width, dial's border color, dial's border width, Start and End position of needle, Grid line width and Grid line color are the new features introduced in the angular gauge chart.Below screenshot is the example where all the dial and grid line properties are applied. Average aggregation is applied for current value and the dial and dial's border properties are applied.Dial's color - blueDial's width - 12Border color - greenBorder width - 2Start position - 65End position - 105Grid line width - 2Grid line color - blackBackground ImageThe steps to set a background image for all Vitara charts are explained in backgroundImage.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideAllCharts/angularGaugeChart.html"}, {"title": "Bar/Column Chart", "body": "Bar/Column ChartA bar chart, often known as a bar graph, is a type of chart that displays\u00a0organized\u00a0data using rectangular bars with lengths proportionate to the values they represent. The bars can be plotted horizontally or vertically. A vertical bar chart is also known as a column bar chart. Users will separate icons for horizontal and vertical charts in\u00a0Vitara Charts\u00a0and will need to switch as needed.InputsMetrics - 1 or more metricsAttributes - 1 or more attributesUse as Filter Option - AvailableThresholdsIn terms of business, specific parts of the chart should be highlighted to attract the attention of decision makers. For example, highlight the stores with total sales greater than a certain amount, or the top ten products with high sales over the previous winter. Thresholds are extremely valuable items in these scenarios.Thresholds will use conditional formatting to highlight specific data points in a chart based on predefined criteria.The qualifications are attribute or metric qualifications. If the expression of a qualification evaluates to TRUE, the report indicates the threshold. Markers can also be included in thresholds.Note: From 4.6 version we can apply thresholds using attributes. The source drop down box in the threshold editor window will list all the attributes and metrics in the chart. we can select an attribute as source and define a threshold condition. The target of the threshold depends on the series of the chart. This means, if the chart series is created using metrics then target drop down box will display the metrics. If we enabled 'color by' mode, by adding an attribute to the 'color by' drop zone in the dossier's editor panel, the chart series will be created using attributes. In this case the threshold target drop down box will show all the elements of attribute used in the color by drop zone. In this case we can set threshold target using attribute.In the threshold, the editor window apply source, target, threshold condition and the other related information to set a threshold on the chart.Apply all the inputs and click on 'Apply' button.From version 4.9.0, we can use pattern fill in thresholds, certain part of the chart can be filled with a pattern.AxesYou can do both Category and Value formattings, by using Title, Label, Axis line and other options in the property editor.Example of text formatting and color formatting for labels, title and axis line in the column chart.Data LabelsFrom 4.1 version, a new property is introduced in bar and column charts to show the data labels outside the bar/column. The option to enable this feature is added in data labels tab with 'Show Label Outside Bar/Column' checkbox. See the screenshot below:By default, this option will be enabled for the charts created from 4.1. Below screenshot shows how the data labels look before and after enabling 'Show Label Outside Bar/Column' optionThe feature 'Show Label Outside Bar/Column' is tied to horizontal data label positions. If the data label is set to appear outside the bar/column, the horizontal data label positions right, left, and centre have no effect on the chart.In VitaraCharts 4.7, a new property called 'Force Outlier Labels Outside' is added to all charts with bars as series. The data labels will be forced to appear outside the bar if this property is set, even if the bar has the maximum value in the chart.See the before and after screenshots for the bar chart.Before:After:SeriesWe can turn the bar/column chart into the combinational chart by changing the 'series type' in the 'series' tab.From version 4.9.0, this charts have the Pattern fill option (Grid/Square/Double Square/Slash) in the Series tab, which allows us to display data in a more presentable manner.Addition of Data Markers through LinksFrom Version 5.1.1, we have added a new feature that allows us to add markers to bar and column charts using image addresses (links).This functionality can be enabled under the series tab with name 'Set DataMarker (link),' where we must enter the URL and press the Apply button.MarkersFrom 4.6 version, the Bar/Column charts as they support Series as Line/Area use the updated marker properties. Open the property editor by clicking on the 'Edit' button and select the Series tab you can see the Enable marker, Marker type and Marker size options to Enable marker properties. Below are the screenshots with the marker options.In the below example, the bar changed to line in series property and 'Thumbs-up' marker is applied for the '2015 Q2' attribute element. Below is the screenshot with the marker applied in the chart.Data Marker from Attribute FormFrom Version 5.1.1, we added a new feature for adding data markers. The dataset must include a column that contains tags or links since these markers will be activated by html tags or links from attribute forms. The markers will automatically display on the chart as soon as this column is included in the attribute form.Below you will find URL dummy dataset created for further explaination:Now, when dataset is being added we have to follow certain steps:First, change the 'Category URL' datatype to URL or HTML tags as shown below: The next step is to create a multi-form attribute using two columns, that can be combined using the Ctrl key, as shown below: Now ,the merged column will show up like this we can now update the changes. Finally, add attributes and metrics to the chosen dropzones to see markers appear on the charts.Column/Bar PropertyFrom 4.5 version of Vitara charts, there is a new property named 'Column' in column chart and 'Bar' in bar chart. You can see properties like Overlay Bar/Column, Bar/Column width, Bar/Column spacing and Series Border Properties. Below is the screenshot of the Bar/Column property editorFrom 4.6 version of Vitara charts, there are two enhancements to the Bar/Column chart.1. Variwide Chart:Variwide chart can be used to visualize a second dimension in a column chart. Each data point is given a weight, in addition to its value, determining the width of the column. It computes the width for the stack to fill the whole plot area, and simply lets the column widths reflect a value.For more details about the Variwide feature please refer to vari_wide.2. Polar ModeIn polar mode, the Bar/Column charts will use a radial value axis. This way of using axes is called Polar coordinate  system.Let's see how to use polar coordinates in simple steps.Step 1:Create a Bar chart with a minimum of one attribute and one metric. See the sample screenshot below.Step 2:Open the property editor and go to the 'Bar' tab. Enable the checkbox 'Enable Polar Mode'. See the screenshot.Then the value axis of the chart will be converted into Polar coordinates. Below screenshot shows the default behaviour of the chart with Polar coordinates.Polar Mode settingsPolar mode comes up four settings which include Start angle, end angle, Outer Pane Size, Inner Pane Size.The default settings of Polar mode areStart Angle: 90, End Angle: 360, Outer Pane Size: 85, Inner Pane Size:20.We can modify these settings anytime according to our preference. Let's see some of the settings belowStart angle  : 180End angle    : 90Outer Pane Size: 90Inner Pane Size: 20Then chart looks like the below screenshotAll the axes settings available for normal Bar chart are also applicable to Polar coordinate systemVariancesFrom 4.7 version of VitaraCharts, 'Variance/Delta' feature is added in Bar/Column charts just like in IBCS charts. To use this feature, the chart should be created with at least 2 metrics and an attributeThe options to enable this feature are available in the Bar/Column tab of the property editor. See the screenshot belowWe have 'Absolute variance' and 'Relative variance' of which either one of them or both can be enabled at a time according to the requirement.To enable Absolute Variance, enable 'Absolute Variance' checkbox in Bar tab of the property editor. We can also set a title for absolute variance graphSee the screenshot below:To enable Relative Variance, enable 'Relative Variance' checkbox in the Bar tab of the property editor. We can also set a title for relative variance graphSee the screenshot below:We can also enable both the absolute and relative variances at once. And the chart looks like in the below screenshot:Play-by AnimationPlay by - animation shows the chart for each element of the first attribute.

Small multiples feature is explained in smallMultiples.Data MarkersFrom the version 4.4, data markers feature is introduced in the Bar/Column charts. To know about Data Markers feature please click  Here.Bar FillFrom version 5.0, the Bar Chart can now show fill percentage, where the fill is displayed as a percentage of the attribute and the remaining space is left empty.We can enable this feature by going to the Bar tab.We can set the Max value for 'Auto' or 'Fixed' or the metrics you've taken.We can specify a value for 'Fixed.'Once the maximum value is set, we can also add an unfilled color.Here is a screenshot of a bar fill using a percentage dataset.Delta BarFrom version 5.0, Delta Bar/Column feature added to chart, which can be enabled by selecting options from the series tab for individual series.There are also options to enable delta Labels, set delta Bar width, and invert delta Bar colors.The delta Bar feature completely disables error bars and vice versa.The image below shows how the Profit of the financial years 2020 and 2021 will be compared, showing both negative and positive deltas.This feature is also available with small multiples and bar variance properties.DeltaBar has been disabled for Bar Fill, Polarmode, Dynamic width, Overlay, IBCS view & Play-Axis, and colour by.Gradient ColorFrom version 5.0, Gradient color fill can be added where the series property is available.It can be enabled by selecting options from the series tab for individual series.It will show the color palette, which will have two selection handles to choose two colors that will render from beginning to end on the series. (From left to right)Zero Value BarIn Version 5.1.1.010, we included a new feature that allows users to show zero value bars. This feature can be enabled under the \u201cBar\u201d tabs, where it can be used to display metrics, whose values are zero.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideAllCharts/barColumnChart.html"}, {"title": "Bubble Chart", "body": "Bubble ChartA Bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of data. The size of the bubble, the color of the bubble and the location can all be used to represent information in an intuitive manner.InputsThree metrics are necessary. The first metric M1 is\u00a0utilized\u00a0for the X-axis, the second for the Y-axis, and the third for determining the size of the bubble. The bubble chart can also be used as a scatter chart because the size of the bubbles does not change. We simply require two measures in this situation, M1 and M2.Attributes - To define the context for the metric data, one or more attributes are necessary. Revenue (M1), Profit (M2), and Profit Margin (M3) are plotted across Month in the example below.Use as Filter Option - AvailableBubble SizeFrom 4.4, a feature is added in Bubble chart to specify the minimum and maximum bubble sizes proportional to the metric values. This is added in the bubble tab of the property editor.The default minimum and maximum bubble sizes are '4' and '40' respectively. See the screenshotNow lets change the bubble sizes and below is the screenshot that shows how bubbles scale according to the sizes specified.ThresholdsIn the business point of view, certain part of the chart needs to be highlighted to draw more attention from the desicion makers. For example, highlight the stores where total sales is greater than a specific value or highlight the top 10 products whose sales is high during last year's winter. Thresholds are very useful objects in these use cases.Thresholds will display some conditional formatting in a chart to highlight certain data points depending on predefined criteria. The criteria are attribute or metric qualifications. If a qualification's expression evaluates to TRUE, the report displays the threshold. We can also include markers in thresholds.Hover the cursor over the chart to apply thresholds in Vitara charts. 'Edit' button will appear on Vitara chart. This \u201cEdit\u201d button will cause the properties window to appear. To open the threshold editor, select the thresholds tab. You have the option to add a new threshold, remove an existing threshold, or change an existing threshold in the window.Note: From 4.6 version we can apply thresholds using attributes. The source drop down box in the threshold editor window will list all the attributes and metrics in the chart. we can select an attribute as source and define a threshold condition. The target of the threshold depends on the series of the chart. This means, if the chart series is created using metrics then target drop down box will display the metrics. If we enabled 'color by' mode, by adding an attribute to the 'color by' drop zone in the dossier's editor panel, the chart series will be created using attributes. In this case the threshold target drop down box will show all the elements of attribute used in the color by drop zone. In this case we can set threshold target using attribute.In the threshold editor window apply source, target, threshold condition and the other related information to set a threshold on the chart.After giving all the inputs click on 'Apply' button.When the bubble chart is working as a scatter chart, thresholds can also set the type of marker to display when the condition is true. In the below screenshot a threshold with markers is set on profit with a condition less than 200K.From version 4.9.0, we can use pattern fill in thresholds (Grid/Square/Double Square/Slash), certain part of the chart can be filled with a pattern.Play-by AnimationPlay by - animation shows the chart for each element of the first attribute. For more details about the play by feature please refer to play-by.From version 4.9.3, we've included the option to switch on Transition lines between the trail and current sequences in the bubble chart.For a specific category axis attribute element, a line will be created between the play axis elements (current play axis value versus first play element OR current play axis value against last but one play axis value).To see the lines, enable the \u201cShow Transition Lines\u201d option in the play axis menu and set the \u201cRetain Points\u201d to 'First' or 'Last but One'.

The bullet graph is used as a replacement for dashboard gauges and\u00a0meters, and it appears to be inspired by the conventional thermometer charts and progress bars present on many dashboards. Since gauges and\u00a0meter\u00a0usually display too little information, take up too much space, and are overloaded with unnecessary and distracting accessory, bullet graphs were created to solve these problems. The bullet graph displays a single, major metric (such as total revenue for the current financial year) and compares it with one or more other measurements to clarify its meaning (such as in comparison to a target).InputsMetrics- At Least 2 metrics are required for this visualization to be meaningful. A base Metric M1, a target M2. Additional target metrics M3, M4, etc can be added as shown below.Attributes - 1 or more attributes can be included.Use as Filter Option - AvailablePlot BandsBullet chart plot bands can be defined based on metric aggregations, similar to bullet chart type in Vitara Micro Chart. By default, the bullet chart will plot  bands based on 'percentile' function on the metric applied in the 'Bar' drop zone.We can edit these default bands and can apply different aggregation functions for different bands. As shown in the below screenshot hover the cursor on the chart, click on the 'Edit' button to get a properties popup window.By default, all bands are plotted based on the 'percentile' value of the metric. We can also make the bands plot using fixed values.In the property editor, go to bullet tab and select 'Fixed Value' from the Metric dropdown. Set some value in the 'Fixed Value' textbox. Repeat this process for whichever bands should have the 'fixed value'. See the screenshot below.And the bands should look like this:Customization of bandsFrom version 5.1, we've included new features for band customization under the Bullets property option, allowing us to add more than four bands.ThresholdsIn the business point of view, certain part of the chart needs to be highlighted to draw more attention from the desicion makers.

The Depth/Direction option will be discussed more in this document.In the current example, the attribute 'Navigation Source' represents the source node and the attribute 'Navigation Target' represents the target node.The Sankey chart will appear in the row data flow model as soon as we choose the source and target properties.The Sankey chart with source and target attributes configured is shown in the screenshot below.In the Sankey chart, we can see the branch that was previously mentioned. Online Order \u2192 Order Submitted \u2192 Payment Verification \u2192 Credit approved/Credit Denied/Credit Review/Order Prepaid/Payment Denied/Processing PaymentIn addition to source and target options Depth/Direction attribute can be used to describe the flow of sankey. Depth can be used to make a node distinct within the flow path.Configuring Depth/Direction:Example 4:Website navigation data indicating users landing and navigation between different pages in a website. In this example there are three attributes - Landing Page, Navigate To, and Level.We can configure the attribute 'Landing Page' as the source of navigation and the attribute 'Navigate To' as the destination for the given use case.The limitation of this strategy is that the same transaction occurs on numerous levels.For example, as seen in the below screenshot, 'Product \u2192 Cart' navigation can happen in level 1,2 and 3.If we don't have the level attribute,Microstrategy will aggregate the row 'product \u2192 cart'. Below are the possible flow paths that use 'product to cart' navigation.                       1. Home \u2192 product, product \u2192 cart (Level-2), and cart \u2192 to home/shipping.                       2. Product \u2192 cart (Level-1), cart \u2192 shipping, and shipping \u2192 order details.                       3. Home \u2192 department, department \u2192 product, product \u2192 cart (Level-3).Therefore to identify all these transitions uniquely at different levels, along with source and target attributes we need another attribute which will have information regarding depthness.Below is the screenshot of sankey chart configuration with all these three attributes.Sankey chart with web navigation example:In the below screenshot, the 'product \u2192 cart' navigation is highlighted in all the three levels.Order of Source, Target, and Depth attributes in the editor panel:When we add an attribute to a\u00a0visualization,\u00a0MicroStrategy\u00a0sorts the attributes alphabetically ascending. As a result, the natural order of events can be disrupted. By creating a new attribute form and sorting the attribute using the newly added attribute form, the natural order of the events can be preserved.The new attribute form should be designed in such a way that the order of events is preserved.Example 5:Let's examine closely the above web navigation example.As per the given use case, below is the screenshot of the correct order of the occurrence of the events.If we change the order of the attributes in the editor panel, the order of events will be disturbed. In the below screenshot the position of the attribute 'Level' is changed, due to which the order of events will affect.Microstrategy will sort the attribute elements using the attribute 'Navigate To' when I insert the attribute 'Level' in the third position in the editor panel drop zone. As a result, the natural order of events will be disrupted.If we use this table to construct the\u00a0Sankey\u00a0chart in the new data model, the result will be as seen in the screenshot below.Instead the correct flow of events should be as shown below.To achieve this, according to the data in the above example, either the attribute 'Level' should be the first attribute in the drop zone so that Microstrategy by default will sort by 'Level' attribute or we should sort the attribute 'Level' in the ascending order.The conclusion is that we should evaluate the order of the events before producing the sankey chart. The events should be in the correct order according to the natural flow of our use case.Insert your data into a visualisation. Check the order of the properties you'll be configuring as Source, Target, and Depth in the editor panel. The sequence of attributes should not disrupt the flow of events.Sankey Chart VerticallyFrom the version 5.0, Sankey chart now stands an ability to use the charts in vertical orientation.The following can be turned ON from the appearance tab from the property editor window.Just toggling on the Invert Axis feature we can change the orientation of the chart.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideAllCharts/sankeyChart.html"}, {"title": "Simple KPI Chart", "body": "Simple KPI chartVitara provides a major KPI number as well as a smaller font number to highlight change or historical performance (for example, representation change from the previous quarter). This visualisation is perfect for expressing vital figures in VI Dashboards and Documents alike.InputsMetrics - 3 metrics, with a minimum of one required. The first metric M1 will be displayed as a large number (Main label), while the second metric M2 will be displayed as a smaller number (Sublabel). The third measure, M3, will be utilised to set background colour thresholds. Metrics can be regular or derived, and they can be formatted as %, Fixed, Currency, and so on.Attributes - OptionalUse as Filter Option - Not availableTip1The screenshot below showcases the KPI widgets formatted with different colors of text and also using metric values formatted as currency and % respectively. By default KPI widget will show the name of the first metric (Main label) as the title of the widget, but we can modify this with our own text input in Appearance ? Text Label ? Label-text input box.KPI widgets can be effectively combined with VitaraCharts' Sparkline to show the trend of the key number for the executive dashboard. See the example below.Autoscaling the labelsBy default, all three labels [main label, sub label, and title] on the Simple KPI chart are auto-scaled.The way the labels are scaled has changed as of version 4.3. So, if we modify the font-size of the Main label, the font-sizes of the Title and Sub label will be scaled proportionately. If you modify the font size for either the Sub label or the Title, the other two labels will not be auto-scaled. Take a look at the image below:If you don't want the Sub label and Title to be auto-scaled with the Main label font-size, just specify the font-size for Sub label and Title. If you want to return any font-size to the default auto-scale, just leave the font-size texbox empty. Take a look at the image below: ThresholdsIn the KPI widget, you can set panel colours and icons using thresholds. Aside from the 'Top Label' and 'Sub Label' drop zones in the editor panel of a dossier, there is a third metric drop zone called 'Threshold Metric' that will be used exclusively for applying thresholds in Simple KPI chart.Open the property editor by clicking on the 'Edit' button and select the 'Threshold' tab. In the threshold, the editor window applies source, target, threshold condition, and other related information. In the below screenshot, for Simple KPI charts panel colors and icons are set using thresholds.Background ImageThe steps to set a background image for all Vitara charts are explained in backgroundImage.When used in combination with small multiples, the basic kpi chart enables for the insertion of a distinct background image based on attribute in addition to the usual background image.StepsDrag attribute into Small Multiple.Add the name of the attribute in background Image path: &[Category].gif (jpg and png are also supported)Add the images in images folder (Tomcat\\webapps\\MicroStrategy\\plugins\\VitaraCharts\\custom\\images) with names as the value of Category like books.jpg, electronics.jpg, music.jpg etcThe names of the images should be in lowercase letters.

For example, highlight the stores where total sales is greater than a specific value or highlight the top 10 products whose sales is high during last year's winter. Thresholds are very useful objects in these use cases.Thresholds will display some conditional formatting in a chart to highlight certain data points depending on predefined criteria.The criteria are attribute or metric qualifications.

Using the 'Stack by %' option, we can adjust the height of the stacked bars based on their % contribution to the total stack value.Stack by MetricsIn 4.2 release the major change in stacked bar/column is, in web documents now we can stack using metrics. Please refer the below screenshot to enable this feature.Adding a line series along with stacked bars/columnsWith the 4.5 edition of the Vitara charts, a new feature in the Stacked bar/column charts allows the user to build a metric series by stacking the attribute values on the same or separate axes.Metric series can be created in three ways: line, area, and data markers.The screenshot below shows a layered Column chart with attributes layered on one axis and a metric series [line] produced on the other. To\u00a0utilize\u00a0metric series, the chart must have two attributes [one as a category and the other as a break by] and at least two metrics [the first metric is always used to establish the value of the bars/columns, and other metrics can be used to make the metric series].Let's look at how to make a metric series in the basic steps below.Step 1Create a stacked bar/column chart with 2 attributes and metrics. Stack by attribute values [i.e drag an attribute into 'break by' dropzone]. See the sample screenshot below.Step 2Open the property editor and go to series tabStep 3Scroll down to see metric selection drop-down at the bottom of the editor. Select a metric with which the series needs to be formed and click on the 'add' button next to it, then the series options menu will be opened. See the screenshot.Step 4Select all required options for that series and click on 'Apply' See the screenshot below.Then metric series will be applied on the chart in the form of 'line graph'. See the screenshot below.Remove the Metric SeriesThe applied series can be removed if the metric respective to that series is removed from the metric dropzone.Pattern Fill in SeriesFrom version 4.9.0, this charts have the Pattern fill option (Grid/Square/Double Square/Slash) in the Series tab, which allows us to display data in a more presentable manner.Polar ModeFrom the 4.6 version of VitaraCharts, a new feature is added in the Stacked charts where users can enable 'Polar mode' i.e, Stacked bar/column chart with a radial value axis. This way of using axes is called Polar coordinate  system.Let's see how to enable 'polar mode' in simple steps.Step 1:Create a Stacked Bar/Column chart with a minimum of one attribute and one metric. See the sample screenshot below.Step 2:Open the property editor and go to the 'Stacked Bar/Column' tab. Enable the checkbox 'Enable Polar Mode'. See the screenshot.Then the value axis of the chart will be converted into Polar coordinates. Below screenshot shows the default behaviour of the chart with Polar coordinates.Polar Mode settingsPolar mode comes up four settings which include Start angle, end angle, Outer Pane Size, Inner Pane Size.The default settings of Polar mode areStart Angle: 90, End Angle: 360, Outer Pane Size: 85, Inner Pane Size:20.We can modify these settings anytime according to our preference. Let's see some of the settings belowStart angle: 0End angle: 270Outer Pane Size: 100Inner Pane Size: 15Then chart looks like the below screenshotAll the axes settings available for normal Bar chart are also applicable to Polar coordinate system.Data labelsWe can format the data labels and Stack totals indepently. Below is the screenshots of this option.From 4.6.1 version of Vitara charts, a new option 'Identify format across the metrics' is introduced in Data labels tab.The number format of stack totals in stacked charts will be the same as the number format of the first statistic in the chart. If the first metric's value is zero or nulls, the stacked chart fails to display the stack totals in the specific number format applied to the metrics.To get over this limitation, we need to enable the 'Identify format across metrics' option. When we enable this attribute, the stacked chart will not rely on the number format of the first metric when establishing the number format for stack totals, but will instead examine all the metrics available in the chart.Example:In the below example, all the metrics in the a stacked chart are formated to a number format to show all numbers in Millions, and everything below the million should be '0'.In this example, the values of Profit metric are below 1 Million, so all the values of the profit metric become zeros. As a result, stacked chart fails in indentifying the number format that should be applied to the stack totals. Hence chart will display stack total in default number format.Below is the screenshot when the option 'Identify format across the metrics' is not enabled.In this use scenario, the chart should take into account not just the first metric but also the number format of other metrics in the chart to establish the number format of the stack totals. The screenshots that demonstrate how to enable the \u201cIdentify format across the metrics\u201d option and the stacked chart that results from doing so are shown below.ThresholdsIn the business point of view, certain part of the chart needs to be highlighted to draw more attention from the desicion makers.

For example, highlight the stores where total sales is greater than a specific value or highlight the top 10 products whose sales is high during last year's winter. Thresholds are very useful objects in these use cases.Thresholds will display some conditional formatting in a chart to highlight certain data points depending on predefined criteria.The criteria are attribute or metric qualifications. If a qualification's expression evaluates to TRUE, the report displays the threshold. We can also include markers in thresholds.To apply thresholds in vitara charts, hover the cursor on the chart. Vitara chart will display an 'Edit' button. When you click on this 'Edit' button the properties window will pop out. Select the thresholds tab to open threshold editor. In the window you can add a new threshold or delete any existing threshold or modify the existing threshold.Note: From 4.6 version we can apply thresholds using attributes. The source drop down box in the threshold editor window will list all the attributes and metrics in the chart. we can select an attribute as source and define a threshold condition. The target of the threshold depends on the series of the chart. This means, if the chart series is created using metrics then target drop down box will display the metrics. If we enabled 'color by' mode, by adding an attribute to the 'color by' drop zone in the dossier's editor panel, the chart series will be created using attributes. In this case the threshold target drop down box will show all the elements of attribute used in the color by drop zone. In this case we can set threshold target using attribute.In the threshold editor window apply source, target, threshold condition and the other related information to set a threshold on the chart.After giving all the inputs click on 'Apply' button.From version 4.9.0, we can use pattern fill in thresholds, certain part of the chart can be filled with a pattern.Background ImageThe steps to set a background image for all Vitara charts are explained in backgroundImage.Gradient ColorFrom version 5.0, Gradient color fill can be added where the series property is available.It can be enabled by selecting options from the series tab for individual series.It will show the color palette, which will have two selection handles to choose two colors that will render from beginning to end on the series.

The property editor provides a list of metrics; each statistic can be extended to select plot settings.We have the Non-Additive option, which means that we cannot include the starting value in the total value, and the Auto compute total option, which means that we can disable the total value in the chart.InputsAttributes: Optional. For the attribute, there are two drop zones. The 'group by' and 'break by' drop zones.Attributes are only required if we wish to establish groups based on attribute values or divide metrics based on attribute values. We can also use both properties together.If you wish to see the metric break up over attribute elements, place an attribute in the 'break by' drop zone. The metric values for each attribute element will be displayed in incremental order.To make small multiples, drag an attribute into the 'group by' zone. Click here to learn more about small multiples. hereMetrics: A minimum of two metrics must be used.The first metric, M1, is used as the starting value, while the second metric, M2, is\u00a0utilized\u00a0to add or remove from the starting value. The final bar (Total) represents the total of metric M1 and metric M2.Option to use as a filter - not\u00a0available.The group by and break by features are described using the following data in the example below.Break by: If we drop the quarter property in the 'break by' drop zone, the chart will default to using the first value of the first measure as the start value. We can also alter it to total or last value if we like. The second metric will be displayed in the break by the quarter attribute format.In our example, the quarterly Delta metric values are added/subtracted in four steps: Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The third metric will be a total of the first and second metrics. Total is the default function for the third metric. We can also apply a break to individual indicators.Group by: When we add an attribute to a group using Dropbox, a separate chart is created for each piece of the attribute.The year attribute is added to the group by drop zone in the preceding example. The year attribute is made up of two elements: 2015 and 2016. The chart will now display the results sorted by year attribute, i.e. quarterly data for 2015 and quarterly data for 2016.AppearanceWe can change the appearance of the waterfall chart by changing the bar colours and width.1. Colours of the barsWe can change the colour of the bars in the Vitara waterfall chart. They are the colour of the up value, the colour of the down value, and the colour of the total bar. These options can be found in the Appearance tab.See the screenshot below for the bar colours that we chose.Green is the up colour, red is the down colour, and blue is the total colour.2. The width of the barIn the waterfall chart, we can also change the width of the bars. To change the width of the bars, go to the appearance tab and enter a value (for example, 10) in the Bar/Column Width input area.Compare the bar width(10) in the screenshot below to the bar width in the screenshot above. Vertical/Horizontal WaterfallIn the Waterfall chart, we have a 'Invert Axes' option that allows us to flip between Vertical and Horizontal Waterfall charts.1. Waterfall in the VerticalThe 'Invert Axes' option is enabled by default, which results in a Vertical Waterfall chart. Vertical waterfall charts have horizontally oriented bars with the category axis shown on a vertical axis. Please see the screenshot below.2. Waterfall HorizontalSimply uncheck the 'Invert Axes' item to use the Horizontal waterfall chart. The bars in the Horizontal waterfall chart are vertical, and the category axis is presented on a horizontal axis.Take a look at the image below:Axes'Auto Compute Start Value' is a unique feature for the value axis in the waterfall chart.This setting will be helpful if we are unsure of which value should be set as the start value and the first metric value in the chart is comparably much larger than the succeeding metric values.Axes > Value axis > Start Value is where you can change this parameter. This option's deactivated mode is the default state. View the ensuing screenshot.Below is the screenshot which shows how the chart looks before and after enabling 'Auto Compute Start Value'If you noticed the above screenshot, the start value in value axis and bar lengths are different. Also the space between the category axis line and bars has also changed.Data LabelsIn the 4.4 edition, a feature is added to the waterfall chart that allows the data labels to be displayed outside of the bar/column. The 'Show Label Outside Bar/Column' checkbox is available in the data labels tab. See the image below.This feature is enabled by default for charts created after 4.1. The screenshot below depicts how the data labels appear after enabling the 'Show Label Outside Bar/Column' option.The option 'Show Label Outside Bar/Column' is tied to horizontal data label positions. For example, if the data label is set to appear outside the bar/column, the horizontal data label locations right, left, and centre will have no effect on the chart.Creating Groups and group settings:The idea of group creation in the waterfall chart is introduced in release 4.2. Metrics of the same kind can be grouped. For instance, group all the measures related to revenue and all the indicators related to expenses. The net profit/loss statement is produced by adding these groups collectively.1. The default Group:A default group is formed by all of the metrics in the chart. We can add new metrics to this default group as well as remove metrics from it. When we add a new metric to a dossier or document, it is placed in the default group. From the metrics in the default group, we may construct a new group. The screenshot below shows the default group when the waterfall chart is given three metrics: Budget, Delta, and Actual.We can rename the default group or any other group. Place the cursor in the group name text input box and type the text you want as the group name.2. Group Settings:Each group will have two options. 1. Add subTotal and 2. Deduct Value. Expand the 'Group Settings' tab to get these options.Add Subtotal:We can create a bar for each group displaying the subtotal of that specific group. Enable the 'Add Subtotal\u201d check box.Deduct Value:The cumulative sum of the metrics/metric groups in the chart will be computed by the waterfall graphic. If we wish to subtract any metric/metric group value from this total, we can do so by selecting the 'Deduct Value' option in that group. For example, in order to construct the profit/loss statement, we must deduct expenses from revenues. In this case, we must enable 'Deduct Value' for the expense-related metric/metric group.3. Creating New groups:To create a new group of metrics please refer the below screenshots.By default all the metrics in the chart will be in the default group. To add metrics to the new group drag and drop the metrics from the default group into the newly created group.Each group will have its own 'Group settings' option and option to create a new group.Plot lineFrom 4.8.0 version, we've introduced plotlines feature to the waterfall chart , plotlines can be added on metric sources in waterfall chart.Background ImageThe steps to set a background image for all Vitara charts are explained in backgroundImage.Small MultiplesWhen we apply an attribute in the 'Group by' drop zone in Vitara charts 4.1, the waterfall chart by default supports small multiple features. To turn off small multiples, enter the property editor by selecting the 'Edit' button. The property editor is seen in the screenshot below.Disable the checkbox 'Enable Small Multiples'.Small multiples is explained in smallMultiples.Zero Value BarIn Version 5.1.1.010, we included a new feature that allows users to show zero value bars.

This implies that when there are two attributes\u00a0in the chart, we can individually control the rotation of each level's axis label. Axis label rotation can also be configured independently for each level when there are 3 attributes. All charts that include horizontal category axis labels are capable of using this feature. Using the example below, let's examine this. With two attributes [Quarter, Month] and a measure, we have a column chart. View the resulting screenshot.See the screenshot belowThe category axis labels at two levels in the above screenshot were rotated to some value by default based on the available space.For each level, we are able to get the labels to spin at a distinct value. For instance, if level 1 = 0, level 2 = -90. Also, have a look at the graphic below to see how things have changed.And let's say we have 3 attributes [year, quarter, month]. We set the rotation for level 1 = -90, level 2 = -45, level 3 = 0. See the screenshot belowValue AxisUnder value axis settings also, we can format the axis labels, axis title, axis line, hide/unhide axis etc. Let's see some of themUse Metric Formatting.Just like we have 'use metric formatting' option for data labels, there is an option added for value axis labels also. This option is available in Axes > Value axis > Label tab of the property editor. See the screenshot belowThis property is linked with the 'metric format' property available in data labels. That means, if you enable this property, the value axis labels take the formatting of the data labels.To understand this, let's take an example of the below screenshotAs you can see in the screenshot above, the datalabels and axis labels formats are distinct. If you want the same format for axis labels, click the 'use metric formatting' box under the value axis tab. The chart then appears as seen below.Take a look at the screenshot below.Tick intervalThe 'Tick interval' setting is now available in the Axes tab as of version 4.3. This feature allows you to change the scale of the value axis.This option may be found in Axes > Value axis > Other. This option is available for both the major and secondary axes. See the image below. Let's see this setting with the example below. We have a bar chart with 2 attributes and 2 metrics.In the following chart, the default tick interval is 2M (two millions). Now we'll change the tick interval to 1M (one million). Simply enter '1000000' in the tick interval textbox to achieve this.See the screenshot below for an updated tick interval on the chart. Setting up the tick interval for values in % format:Below is a column chart with metrics in percentage format.The default tick interval for the above chart is 10%. Now we will customize the tick interval to 5%. For this to happen, we have to put '0.05' the tick interval textbox instead of '5%'See the below screenshot which shows the updated tick intervalStart / End ValuesThe value axis can have start and end values set. A metric, fixed value, or percentile basis can be used to specify the start or end value.Axes > Value Axis > [Start Value, End Value] provides access to these properties.View the property editor in the screenshot.Let us discuss start/end values with an example belowAll four bar values in the screenshot above are greater than 30.7% and less than 31.2%.

To use the new capability, users might need to make some adjustments.Changes to the Vitara charts' Backwards CompatibilityReport Services Documents : Use of attributes in colummns or Metrics in RowsThis applies exclusively to report services materials, not dossiers. VitaraCharts requires the user to\u00a0organize\u00a0attributes into rows and measurements into columns. This is done in the report services document design mode. Prior to 4.2, this was not explicitly verified for, and VitaraCharts appeared to work in some circumstances. Starting with version 4.2, an explicit error will be raised when you insert an attribute in a column or metrics in rows. The problem was only raised in version 4.1 when metrics were in rows. In other words, if you have a document saved previous to 4.1 that has characteristics in columns or metrics in rows, the chart will no longer render and an error notice will appear. You have to just go to the design mode and move the attributes to rows and metrics to columns.Fonts in Charts created prior to 4.1 now look different (in 4.2 and newer)Please review this page for details on how to fix this issue.Stack Totals in Stacked Bar/ Column chartsOnly charts created/modified after version 4.0 have Stack Totals for Stacked Bar/Column charts enabled (by default). When dossiers prepared with stacked bar/column charts in the 3.9 build are opened in the 4.0 through 4.3 versions, the stack totals are displayed by default.Stack totals are disabled by default in the 4.4.2.618 edition of Vitara charts to meet the customer's requirement for backwards compatibility from the 3.9 version.The screenshots below are from the 3.9 and 4.0 releases, where stacktotals are not visible in the 3.9 build but are visible in the 4.0 to 4.3 builds by default.In the below screenshot, the StackTotals are not enabled by default in 4.4.2.618 version of Vitara charts.Data Labels Contrast color in XY chartsThe data label contrast colour feature has been introduced to the following chart series: bar, column, area, stacked bar, stacked column, histogram, column range, and bubble. This functionality is enabled by default for the previously mentioned series type and is backwards compatible with versions up to and including the 3.9 release.The data label contrast\u00a0color\u00a0feature is not enabled in versions 4.0 to 4.3.We implemented the feature in Vitara charts 4.4.2.618 again to meet the customer's demand for backwards compatibility.The screenshots below are from the 3.9 and 4.0 releases, where data labels contract colour can be seen in the 3.9 build but not in the 4.0 to 4.3 builds.In the below screenshot, the data labels contrast color feature is shown in 4.4.2.618 version of Vitara charts.Hide Axis option updateThe Hide Axis option in prior builds before 4.3 conceals the Axis labels, Axis lines, and Axis title, but in the 4.3 release, the axis hiding option covers only the Axis labels, Axis lines, and not the Axis title.The samples below show the hide axis option in disabled and enabled states in the 4.0 version.The same dossier with hide axis option enabled is opened in the 4.3 version shows the Axis title and hides the Axis lines and Axis labels.Waterfall default styling updateThe Waterfall chart is displayed by default in the Horizontal axis position up until version 4.1. Since version 4.2 and up, the vertical axis is displayed, and the 'Invert Axis' property is by default enabled.However, documents written using a waterfall chart up until version 4.1 and opened in version 4.2 would only display in the horizontal axis. Therefore, there is no issue with the Waterfall chart's backwards compatibility.The Waterfall chart from Vitara Charts, made in version 4.1 and opened in version 4.2, is shown in the screenshots below.This is the dossier created in the 4.2 version shown with vertical axis by default.Axis label property 'Show Attribute ID' updated in 4.4 versionIn the Column, Bar, Stacked column, Stacked bar, Waterfall, Trellis, Heatmap, Line, Sparkline, Area charts there is a new option from 4.4 version in Axis Label property In the Column, Bar, Stacked column, Stacked bar, Waterfall, Trellis, Heatmap, Line, Sparkline, and Area charts, the Axis Label setting 'Show Attribute ID' is now enabled by default in the 4.4 version. If we open the same dossier in the 4.4 build, we can see an option to 'Hide/Show Attribute ID'. Because the 'Show attribute ID' option is enabled by default, we can now see the Desc and ID in the Category axis labels.Below is the example of column chart, where the attribute forms are enabled in the 4.3.3.582 version of Vitara charts.The same dossier when opened in 4.4 version will show the attribute ID enabled form by default.Pie chart - Show Total in Center LabelIn the 4.0.5.424 build version, the data labels in the Pie chart have been updated so that you can view the Metric Total in the pie chart when 'Show Total in Centre Label' is enabled. In previous versions, you could only see the hovering values, and a dossier produced in 3.9 build and opened in 4.0 build would not show the Total because it is not enabled by default.The examples in the 3.9 and 4.0 builds are shown below.The highlighted element 'Electronics 2015 Q4' has an 8.6% value in the Pie chart below.In the below Pie chart, the center text is showing the element 'Books 2015 Q1' 0.6% value and the show total is in disabled state.In the pie chart, the center text is showing the element 'Cost 22M' value and the show total is in enabled state.Font changes in Grid chartBy default font changed to Arial from Times New Roman in 4.2. The dossier or document created in 4.0 Grid chart and opened in 4.2 version will display the Arial font.In the 4.1 version you can see the default font is Times New Roman.In the 4.2 version you can see the default font is Arial.Children count are hidden in 4.2 by default.A change is made in Grid chart property in the 4.2 build, where by default the children count be in hidden mode. In the earlier versions it used to be in unhidden mode till 4.1 version.In the 4.1 version you can see by default the children count is in Unhidden mode.In the 4.2 version you can see by default the children count is hidden.Threshold Icons replaced as Markers from 4.3 versionThe Icons have been replaced by Markers in the Vitara Grid chart's 4.3 version. As a result, dossiers generated prior to 4.2 version using thresholds with Icons will be replaced by markers. And the marking will be disabled by default in the 4.3 build.The screenshot below shows the threshold editors using Icons in the 4.2 build and Markers in the 4.3 build.Color by option added in Column Range chartThe colour by option was not accessible in the Column range chart until version 4.4. Only the option to play by attribute is accessible in report service documents. The colour by option is included in Vitara charts starting with version 4.5. Colour can be seen in papers created on the 4.5 version.The screenshots below show the colour by option in the 4.5 version and merely the play by attribute option in the 4.0 version of vitara charts.Packed Bubble default legend size changed in 4.5The Packed bubble chart now has a different default text size for the legend. In earlier releases of 4.5, the legend text size is set to '9' by default. It is '12' from builds 4.5 and higher.You can see that the legend size is set by default to '6' text size in versions 4.0 to 4.4. See the screenshot I've given below.In the 4.5 version, you can see by default the legend size is '12' text size. See the below attached screenshotCalendar Heatmap default legend size changed in 4.5The Calendar Heatmap chart now has a different default text size for the legend. In earlier releases of 4.5, the legend text size is set to '6' by default. It is '12' from builds 4.5 and higher.You can see that the legend size is set by default to '6' text size in versions 4.0 to 4.4. See the screenshot I've given below.In the 4.5 version, you can see by default the legend size is '12' text size.

The legends, thresholds, data labels, appearance, tooltip, series, and axes tabs all have this feature.In the example below, we can observe that\u00a0the 'revenue' metric overlaps the 'cost' and 'profit' metrics, preventing us from seeing past the chart's overlapping region.So, from the below image when we adjust the opacity of the 'revenue' from Series tab, we can see that the 'cost' and 'profit' metrics are clearly visible.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideCommonFeatures/colorpickerwithopacity.html"}, {"title": "Custom SVG Markers", "body": "Custom SVG MarkersNote: Vitara Charts supports only SVG files as custom markers.Two simple steps to use custom images as markers:1. The svg file's locationThe SVG files can be used as custom marker in two ways:Physical SVG file:Step 1:Copy the images which you want to set as a custom marker in the below folders.1. tomcat\\webapps\\MicroStrategy\\plugins\\VitaraCharts\\custom\\images2. tomcat\\webapps\\MicroStrategyLibrary\\plugins\\VitaraCharts\\custom\\images3. /var/opt/MicroStrategy/install/Export/resources/plugins/VitaraCharts/custom/images/The paths listed above are merely examples; you must use comparable paths based on your server's folder structure and the web server you are using.It is necessary to copy the SVG image files to all three of the above locations.Step 2:Open the custom marker tab and enter the image name, including the extension '.svg', in the \u201cSVG path\u201d text input box.Then, press the 'Apply' button. The custom marker is visible on the chart.Please keep in mind that the image name is case sensitive.Using Web URL:If you have a web URL for an SVG image file that you wish to use as a custom marker, you can paste it directly into the text input box of the custom marker tab. Then, press the 'Apply' button. The custom marker is visible on the chart. There is no need to physically copy the image files anywhere using this procedure.Note: Using a web URL is currently not possible in the Android library application or the Android mobile application.If you solely use vitara\u00a0charts in the MicroStrategy web application and web library application, this is sufficient.If you are also using\u00a0Vitara\u00a0charts in mobile applications (library app and mobile app), proceed to the next stage.2. Configuration of library and mobile applicationsDeploy vitara charts library and mobile plugins in the MicroStrategy library and mobile application respectively.We have to configure the vitara charts so that custom markers can work in library and mobile applications.Configuration steps for library application:Step1:Access the config.jsp file in the vitara charts MicroStrategy library plugins, using the below sample URL in any browser.https://MicroStrategyLibraryServer/plugins/VitaraCharts/config.jsp Example: http://example.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/plugins/VitaraCharts/config.jspStep2:In the configuration page, enter the MicroStrategy web application URL.Example: \u200bhttp://example.com/MicroStrategy/   <br/>Click the **Submit** button.Configuration steps for mobile application:Step1:Access the config.jsp file in the vitara charts MicroStrategy mobile plugins, using the below sample URL in any browser.https://MicroStrategyMobileServer/plugins/VitaraCharts/config.jsp Example: http://example.com/MicroStrategyMobile/plugins/VitaraCharts/config.jsp)Step2:In the configuration page, enter the MicroStrategy web application URL.Example: http://example.com/MicroStrategy/   <br/>Click the **Submit** button.Custom svg markers are visible in my chart, but unable to change the color via series tab or thresholding?Paths (which inform the browser how to draw the shape) are defined in SVG files. The path might be closed (such a circle, oval, square, or any other shape that makes a closed space) or open. The path may already have a 'fill' parameter that specifies how the closed form should be coloured in the svg. So the circumstances under which you can apply a colour to a marker are as follows:The file should contain (at least one) closed shape.The file should not already contain a fill attribute for the closed form.Example with-fill:In this svg file, the fill property is already specified with Yellow color(#fedb41).As you can see below, with this type of svg marker you cannot set a color via series/thresholds options.Example no-fill:You can see in the below screenshot that this svg marker doesn't have 'fill' proprty defined.So, in vitara charts, you can modify the color of this type of svg markers using either series option or thresholds.How to use custom SVG markers in vitara charts is explained in detail here", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideCommonFeatures/customSVGMarkers.html"}, {"title": "Data Markers", "body": "Data MarkersIn traditional charts, data points are represented by bars and lines. Users of Vitara charts will be able to utilise markers to indicate the data points starting with version 4.4.The markers menu offers a selection of data markers that you can choose from, or you can upload your own custom markers.The bar, column, line, area, sparkline, grid, and micro charts all have the data markers feature.    The following section will explain how to show a marker on the bar chart instead of bars.In the vitara bar chart click on 'Edit' button to open the properties window.In the properties window open the 'Series' menu. Click on 'Edit' for the series on which you want to show the data markers.Expnad the 'Type' drop down box, and select the option 'Data Markers'. When we select the option 'Data Markers', the series window will display all the options related to data markers.In the below screenshot the basic properties of the data markers like marker selection, marker color and marker size are highlighted.Marker Type, Marker Size and Marker ColorClick on the marker icon to open the marker selection window. Please refer to the below screenshot.After selecting the desired marker close the marker selection window. Select the size of the marker and color.Below is the screenshot of bar chart in which the bars are replaced with marker.Keep aspect ratioWhen we enable data markers, we will see one marker for each data point. The position of the data marker is determined by the data point's value. If we disable the Keep aspect ratio attribute, the data marker will be stretched to fill the space between the axis origin, i.e. 0, and the data point value.Below is the screenshot of how the data markers looks when we disable Keep Aspect ratio property.Repeat MarkerIn normal mode, one data marker is displayed for each data point. The data markers will be generated from a bar/column shape filled with markers when the Repeat Marker attribute is used. The marker will be filled with a certain number of rows inside each bar.Enable the check box Repeat Marker.Select nummber of units per row. Click on apply.FillIf we choose fill mode, the data markers will be filled with a color depending on the value we set as Maximum value (while the marker size remains the same for all data points).Data markers as scatter chartPrior to 4.4, we could use the choices in the series tab to construct the scatter chart. We deleted the \u201cScatter\u201d option from the \u201cSeries\u201d menu in the 4.4 version. We may now use the \u201cData Markers\u201d option to create scatter plots. The series-type drop down box will appear like this in the 4.4 release.Below are the steps to implement the scatter chart using the Vitara charts 4.4 version.Step 1: Use a Vitara Bar/column chart.Step 2: In the \u201cAppearance\u201d tab, enable the option \u201cOverlay Bar/Column\u201d.Step 3: Open the \u201cSeries\u201d tab and for the metric which you want to show as a simple tick, click on 'Edit'.Step 4: Select the series type as \u201cData Markers\u201d.Step 5: When we select the option 'Data Markers', the series window will display all the options related to data markers.Step 6: Click on \u201cApply\u201d button.Custom SVG MarkersA new feature has been added to the 4.5 edition of vitara charts, allowing users to customise the data markers. This implies that the user can upload a local svg file to the server and use it as a data marker in Vitara charts.Custom svg markers can be used in the attributes of the following vitara charts:        Series tab,         Markers tab, and         Thresholds tab.  This feature is supported in the below charts.Area, Bar, Bubble, Bullet, Column, Dumbbell, Histogram, Line, Simple KPI, Slope, Sparkline, Tornado, Trellis, and Waffle.Custom SVG markers can be used in the thresholds starting with Vitara Charts 4.6.1. The user can then submit the .svg file to the server and use it as a data marker in the Vitara Grid display.Lets see how to use custom markers in the below steps. For better understanding of the process, we will consider the custom svg file as 'car.svg' in this exampleStep 1:Upload an svg file [car.svg in this case] into the server to this path in the plugins folder. {VitaraCharts/custom/images/}Step 2:Create any chart [line chart for example] that supports custom svg markers. Go to the marker tab, enable marker and click the 'marker type' icon, then the marker selection window will be opened. See the screenshot below.Step 3:Go to the Custom tab. Enter the name of the file in the SVG path textbox [e.g, car.svg(name is case sensitive)] and click on 'Apply' and close the marked selection window. See the screenshot belowThen the custom svg marker[car] gets applied on the chart. see screenshot belowIn this way, the custom markers can be applied from the Series tab and Thresholds tab as well.Custom SVG markers in Data LabelsCustom svg markers are supported in data labels generated by thresholds, and various svg markers can be used to make the data labels more presentable to the applicable threshold.The example below shows how to use 'sun.svg' as a custom marker on the threshold with data labels enabled.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideCommonFeatures/dataMarkers.html"}, {"title": "Data label customization", "body": "Use Metric FormattingWhen we activate data labels in any of the\u00a0Vitara\u00a0charts, the data labels are displayed in shortened format by\u00a0default.To\u00a0show the data labels in the same format as the metric's data format, pick the Use Metric Formatting option from the data labels menu. The screenshot below was taken after enabling the Use Metric Formatting option.If the metric's data don't have currency symbols, then how to display currency symbols in the data labels.Lets consider the data as shown in the below screenshot. Here the metric Sales does not have dollar sign.If we wish to display this data using vitara charts and include the dollar symbol in the data labels, we must first add the dollar sign to the data. Edit the metric's number format in the MicroStartegy and select the appropriate format.Below is the screenshot of the data after selecting currency number format with dollar sign.Now apply vitara chart, for example, vitara column chart.When we enable data labels, by default vitara chart will display data labels in its own format i.e. short format.If we want to the values in the MicroStrategy format we have to enable the use metric formatting option.Below is the screenshot of the vitara column chart after enabling the use metric formatting. Now we can see the dollar sign in the data labels.Note: When we enable the use metric formatting option in the data labels menu, the tooltip also will be displayed in the same format as the data labels.Display axis labels in MicroStrategy number format.To display axis labels in MicroStrategy number format, first activate the\u00a0utilize\u00a0metric formatting option in the data labels menu, and then enable it in the axis labels menu. The screenshot below shows how to enable metric formatting in the axis labels menu.Data label customizationIn 4.2 release customization of data, labels has been introduced. We can modify the default data labels using text and dynamic macros for data. Below is the screenshot of the data labels editor window.Hover the cursor over the 'i' symbol to see the available macros for any particular chart. Below is the screenshot.In the editor window type '&' character and you will see macro suggestions. Select the macros and click on '\u201cApply\u201d tab.For example, the default macros in the above screenshot is &[point.value], So the chart shows the metric value at each data-point. See the screenshot below:Now we will use custom macros in this way &[point.metricName]: &[point.value], point.metricname is colored red. And the data labels will display this way now. See the screenshot below:In this way, users can use either text or other macros or combination of both in many possible ways.Show Overlapping Data LabelsFrom 4.1 version, all vitara charts are added with the support to show the overlapping data labels. This feature is added in data labels tab with 'Show Overlapping Labels' checkbox.For example, in line chart when you enable data labels, only few labels are shown on the chart respective to the space available between the datapoints. See the screenshot below:Now, the new feature allows to forcefully show all the data labels. To do this, go to data labels tab and enable the 'Show Overlapping Labels' checkbox. See the screenshot below:Attribute forms in Data labelsWe may now select a certain attribute form to display on the chart for Data labels. And we can only select the attribute form macros for the chart's last attribute.For example, suppose there are two attribute forms enabled attributes, 'category'\u00a0and 'subcategory'. Then, if necessary, we can display the attribute forms for both attributes.Use &[point.category@DESC] or &[point.category@ID] or both macros depending on the necessity to display the chart's default attribute forms in the data labels. Take a look at the image below.To display attribute forms only for a specific attribute, then choose it from data label macros list. e.g, Category@DESC, Category@ID, Subcategory@DESC, Subcategory@ID.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideCommonFeatures/datalabelCustomization.html"}, {"title": "Dossiers/Documents differences", "body": "Functional Differences using Vitara Charts in Dossiers and Report Service DocumentsIntroductionFrom 10.3 and higher, the Vitaracharts visualisation library can be used for Report Services as well as Visual Insights/Dossier.

In the editor panel, new drop zones such as Category Axis,\u00a0Color\u00a0by, Value, Tooltip, Play axis, Small multiple, and drilling will be visible.To display traits and metrics on the chart, simply drag and drop them into the appropriate drop zone.The metrics that we place in the 'Value' drop zone appear on the graphic.The metrics we placed in the 'Tooltip' drop zone did not appear in the chart, however their values are visible in the tooltip. We can also use the metrics in the 'Tooltip' drop zone to establish thresholds in the chart.DocumentsThis feature is not present in the report services documents.

Please see the screenshots below for further information.Example:Vitara Area ChartIn Documents and DossiersSmall Multiples:Dossiers: Drag and drop any attribute into the 'Small Multiples' drop zone to use the small multiples capability in dossiers.Documents: To activate Small Multiples in documents, launch the vitara property editor window and navigate to the 'Small Multiples' option. The screenshot below shows a modest numerous feature in dossiers and documents.The below screenshot demonstrates small multiple feature in dossiers and in documents.Drill Target:The drill feature is available in bar, column, line, and pie charts.Dossiers: In dossiers, drag and drop an attribute into the 'Drill Target' drop zone to enable the chart's drilling capability. When we place an attribute in the 'Drill Target' drop zone, the vitara property editor will display the drilling tab.Documents:  Place at least two attributes in the grid to enable the drill functionality in the documents. The 'Drillin' tab in the docs vitara property editor allows us to enable/disable the drilling feature.Chart-wise differencesMost of the features in Vitaracharts has the same functionality in Report Service Documents and in Dossiers, but the way we  enable/disable those features have some differences.1. Vitara Stacked Bar/Column chartsDossiers:Stacked Bar/Column charts in dossiers will display two drop zones for attributes: 'Category Axis' and 'Break by'. Case 1: If we place one or more attributes in the 'Category Axis' drop zone but none in the 'Break by' drop zone, the chart will generate a series based on metrics. This signifies that the measures in the chart are layered. Case 2: If we place an attribute in the 'Break by' drop zone (whether or not we have attributes in the 'Category' drop zone), the chart will construct a series using the attribute in the 'Break by' drop zone. Stacking is done in this instance utilising attributes rather than measurements.Documents:In docs charts, series are always drawn using characteristics. This means that we can only stack attributes. In report services documents, metrics cannot be stacked in stacked bar/column charts. Please see the screenshots below.2. Vitara Simple KPI chartDossiers: Use Top Label and Sub Label drop zones in dossiers to display KPI metrics. Use the Threshold metrics drop zone to place more than two metrics in the chart and to define thresholds on Top Label and Sub Label metrics. A Small Multiples attribute in the drop zone will enable the Small Multiple functionality.Documents: The first metric in documents will be regarded Top Label, and the second metric will be considered Sub Label. The third metric on the words chart will be Threshold metrics. Using the edit property window, you may enable the Small Multiples functionality.3. Vitara KPI Ring ChartIt is simple to categorise metrics in Dossiers as Ring 1 Value, Ring 2 Value, and Ring 3 Value. We have a property editor option in Documents to show the number of rings to display in the chart. You can see a clear example in the screenshot below.In Dossiers just drop an attribute in Small Multiples drop zone to enable Small Multiples feature.In documents Small Multiples feature can be enabled using property editor window.4. Vitara Micro ChartTo view the graphic, you must have a minimum of two attributes and a maximum of one metric.We must apply two attributes in Dossiers, one in the 'Category Axis' drop zone and one in the 'Trend by' drop zone. We can only use two qualities at a time.We can put any number of attributes in the grid in Documents. If we use more than two properties in the grid, the micro chart will only use the top two to create the chart. Metrics are not limited; we can include as many as we like in the graphic.5. Vitara ColumnRange, Bullet, Bubble, Funnel and Pie chartsA. Column Range chartTo apply Colour by and Play by drag & drop attributes into the corresponding drop zones in Dossiers.Colour By Last Attribute and Play By First Attribute can be enabled/disabled in Documents via the property editor box. Hover your mouse over any vitara chart to reveal the 'Edit' button. To launch the vitara property editor window, click the 'Edit' button.B. Bullet chartIn Documents the properties Color By Last Attribute and Play By First Attribute can be enable/disabled using the property editor window. Hover the cursor over any vitara chart to get 'Edit' button. Click on the 'Edit' button to open vitara property editor window.In Dossiers to enable Color By Last Attribute, Play By First Attribute and Small Multiples drag and drop attributes into the respective drop zones.C. Bubble chartIn Documents the properties Color By Last Attribute, Play By First Attribute and Small Multiples can be enable/disabled using the property editor window. Hover the cursor over any vitara chart to get 'Edit' button. Click on the 'Edit' button to open vitara property editor window. In Dossiers to enable Color By Last Attribute, Play By First Attribute and Small Multiples drag and drop attributes into the respective drop zones.D. Funnel chartIn Dossiers we have Slice by drop zone, for each combination of attribute elements one slice will be created. Attributes can be added to Play Axis Drop Zone as well.In Documents the Play By First Attribute is enabled using the property editor.For clear idea you can look at the screenshot below.Below is the screenshot of property editor window of Column Range, Bubble, Funnel and Pie chart.E. Pie chartIn Dossiers you will have Slice by option where, it creates each combination of attribute elements one slice will be created. Attributes can be added to Play Axis and Small Multiples Drop ZoneIn Documents the Play By First Attribute and Small Multiples is to enabled in the property editor.6. Vitara Dumbbell, Histogram, Trellis chartsA. Histogram and Trellis ChartColour can be selected for the Vitara Histogram and Trellis charts. You can easily drop down from the data set in the Colour By Drop Zones in Dossiers. Colour By Last Attribute must be enabled in the Documents property editor.You can see a clear example in the screenshot below.B. Dumbbell ChartColour by and Small Multiples options are available on the Vitara Dumbbell chart. You can easily drop down from the data set in the Colour By Drop Zones in Dossiers. Colour By Last Attribute and Small Multiples must be enabled in the Documents property editor.7. Vitara WaterFall ChartWe can easily drop down the qualities in Dossiers into the Group by and Break by options.In Documents, if we supply two attributes, the chart will treat one as Group by attribute and the other as Break by attribute, but we don't have the opportunity to pick only the Break by choice on attribute, although it is simply applicable in Dossier. You can see a clear example in the screenshot below.8. Vitara Spacer ChartIn Dossiers, spacer chart will render without adding any attribute/ metric in the dropzones.In Documents we need to have at least one attribute or metric to render the chart.9. Vitara Heat MapIn documents we can give any number of attributes but in dossiers we can give only two attributes; one attribute in 'Category Axis' drop zone and in one 'Vertical Axis'.10.

One is the basis measure for which the error bars are calculated. 'Error-Low Value' and 'Error-High Value' are the other two measures.Example:Consider the following example: the open and closing values of the Amazon.com, Inc. stock price for the month of November 2019. I'd want to show the day's high and low values as error bars on the close value measure. The following attributes and metrics are utilised in the example:Attributes:  1.DateMetrics:   1.Open ($),  2.Close ($),  3.Day High ($),  4.Day Low ($).Step 1:Insert a\u00a0Vitara\u00a0bar/column/line chart into a dossier/document. I\u00a0utilized\u00a0a\u00a0Vitara\u00a0column chart in this instance. Initially, I added metrics for Open ($) and Close ($) to the Vitara column chart.I'd like to display the error bars on the Close ($) metric's bars. Insert the Day High ($) and Day Low ($) metrics into the Tooltip dropzone. The metric Day Low ($) should be set as the error bar's low value, and the metric Day High ($) should be set as the error bar's high value.Step 2:To reveal the Edit button, move the cursor over the Vitara chart. To access the properties pane, click on the Edit button. Open the Series menu in the properties pane.In basic terms, the series properties will be set up via the Series menu.

For the metric Close ($) in the present example, click Edit.Step 3:In the series properties there is a check box Show Error Bars. Click on this check box to enable Error Bars in the chart.Step 4:When error bars are enabled, the drop-down list boxes to set low and high values for error bars appear in the series properties menu. Select the measurements you wish to designate as low and high values by expanding the drop-down list. then decide on the error bar's\u00a0color.

If the VitaraCharts folder on the web server has been configured with different access privileges than the rest of the MicroStrategy Web installation. If that's the case, you might try changing their access rights to match the rest of the folders.We are getting an error with \u201cHttp Status Code 401\u201d in the exported pdf file.The error (401) indicates that there is a problem with accessing the web server. In order to create the PDF document, the PDF export server must communicate with the web server. So the first step would be to ensure that the PDF export engine (which should be on the same computer as the intelligence server) can reach the web server (through the network).When the configuration is not done correctly, not only VitaraCharts but also any of the custom chart plugins will not function properly.If the connectivity troubles persist, it may be preferable to contact MicroStrategy for network configuration assistance.When I export to pdf, the Vitara Charts get cut off after one page. Doing the export with a regular MSTR Grid works fine and splits the grid over more pages. How to split vitara charts into multiple pages?Unfortunately, MicroStrategy does not support exporting several pages of customised visuals. Essentially, exporting custom visuals is similar to taking a screenshot; whatever is displayed within the context of the website will be exported. Of course, you can adjust the page parameters during export (as you have already attempted) to ensure that your page is as large as feasible.We've also requested that MicroStrategy improve their API to support several pages of bespoke visual export. The case number is 358341.How can we generate the export engine logs?Please check the following link for info on export engine logsTroubleshooting the export engineExports come with a black background and nothing else is displayed.The issue is caused by network setup (or possibly by web server configuration). Could you please try to access vitaraGlobal.css from the server where the export engine is running? A sample URL for doing so is shown below: https://xyz.com/MicroStrategy/plugins/VitaraCharts/style/vitaraGlobal.css Simply copy and paste the URL into your browser (this must be done on the export engine machine). If that returns a proper answer (i.e. displays the CSS file in the browser window or prompts you to download the file), the setting is correct and we must hunt elsewhere for the problem. If it fails to load, this must be addressed first (by your web/network administrator).If this access issue is resolved, the black background issue should be resolved.You can also check MicroStrategy's troubleshooting tech note for export:Troubleshooting the new export engineThis talks about the 'Request Failed' errors and wants the user to check 'to Make sure the account used to start the export engine has read-access to the  file'.When we exporting Vitara Chart in the result from Dossier to PDF we noticed the below issues:     1.Some Metric Value Data labels are missing.     2.Y-Axis values also change. The size of the page used in the pdf layout will be different from what is seen on the screen. With export, the summary view of the dossier is generated on one page and then a separate page is created for each chart on the same chapter/sheet. The separate page size (aspect ratio) will not exactly match the aspect ratio of the visual as seen in the dossier. For this reason sometimes vitara charts may include some extra data labels or disappear existing data labels in the PDF. Sometimes in the original view some rows are partially cut-off while they are seen in the pdf export.What are the MicroStrategy compatible environments for export to PDF to work in Vitara charts?Only with version 10.6 has MicroStrategy supported the export of custom visuals. Previously, simply a grid would be exported. Export to PDF from online dossiers, web library, and workstation is supported in vitara charts.Custom graphics from Documents cannot be exported by MicroStrategy. This is a shortcoming in MicroStrategy for which we have repeatedly requested a fix.What is the workflow of VitaraCharts export to PDF?It's a straightforward one-way trade. VitaraCharts' scope is entirely contained to the web-server and makes no requests to the i-server or any other service. When you export a dashboard/dossier to PDF, the intelligence server's PDF service runs the dashboard and takes a screenshot of the output to include in the PDF.What are the basic troubleshooting steps I can perform if I have problems with export to PDF?i) Only with version 10.6 has MicroStrategy supported the export of custom visuals. Check the version of MicroStrategy you're using.ii) Export to PDF in any custom visualisations will only function with dossiers. When you try to export data from Web documents to PDF, you will obtain data in a grid format.iii) You can export any other custom visual from the gallery (that Vitara does not provide) from a dossier.This helps determine whether the problem is with exporting any custom visuals (suggesting a configuration issue) or a VitaraCharts-specific issue.In Dossiers/documents does VitaraCharts support export to  Excel?No, Exporting to excel is not supported.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideCommonFeatures/exportToPdf.html"}, {"title": "Formatting metric data", "body": "Formatting metric dataUse the Number Format option under the right click menu on a metric name (from the dossier's dataset panel) to define the desired format.All formats available under the Number Format menu are supported (except aggregated values are not formatted in fraction)Red color coding for negative numbers is not supported (in any format).

To access the properties window, click the Edit button.Step 2:Activate the Tooltip menu. Two icons for the link and unlink features are present in the tooltip menu, as seen in the screenshot below.Select the tooltip text for which the link needs to be included in the tooltip editor box. Alternatively, manually insert text in the tooltip window (for example, 'click here for detailed report'), select the text, and click on the link icon, as seen in the screenshot below. After that, a new 'Enter a URL to link' window will appear.Step 3:Enter the link URL in the 'Enter a URL to link' field. The URL can point to a report, a document/dossier, or a website. Now, click the Add button, followed by the Apply button.In the screenshot below, for example, a link to a microstrategy report has been added.Step 4:Hover the mouse over the chart to reveal the tooltip, then click on the words for which the link was created. The URL of the link will then be accessed in a new browser tab. This allows the user to add as many links as they want.Tooltip links support for URL APITooltip links can be upgraded to support URL API with dynamically changing urls by using macros.To add the links, repeat steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 from the previous section.For instance, suppose you have a dossier with the attributes year, category, and metrics profit, last\u00a0year's profit. And if you want to see the quarterly statistics for a specific year in another document/dossier, the link that needs to be included should be as follows.In the above URL, macros for the year property are\u00a0utilized, so that clicking on the tooltip link of a certain data point will transmit the associated year value to answer the 'year prompt' in the target document/dossier.When we hovered over the year:2015 tooltip link in the screenshot below, the year in the URL API was also modified to 2015.After clicking on the year:2015 tooltip link, the quarterly statistics for 2015 will be displayed in the target document/dossier.Unlink:There are two methods for removing the linkages.Select the text on which the link is applied in the tooltip editing box, then click the Unlink icon.

The first one square button shows the metrics you want to sort and the second one shows the order what you want to sort. See the screenshot below.Advanced Sorting using the Hamburger optionFrom the Hamburger menu, Select any metric, select Advanced Sorting and click on Manage Sorting, it will take you to the Editor tab. See the screenshot below.Advanced Sorting using Right Click propertiesFrom the Right Click Menu, Select Advanced Sorting then click on Manage Sorting you can able to apply to sort in the Property editor window. See the screenshot below.Advanced Sorting on Grouping LevelAdvanced Sorting can be applied on grouping levels too. Now, once grouping is applied in the grid, there is a button added in the property editor. See the screenshot below where the Sorting is applied on a discount on a product category level.Sorting based on attribute forms in the Vitara Grid chartFrom the 4.3 release, Vitara chart supports multiple attribute forms. In the normal XY charts multiple attribute forms are concatenated and in the grid and micro charts each attribute form will be shown as separate column.In the below screenshot, for the attribute \u201cCustomer\u201d the attribute forms \u201cCustomer First Name\u201d and the \u201cCustomer Last Name\u201d are enabled.As shown in the above screenshot, each attribute form will be displayed as a separate column in the Vitara grid chart.We can sort the Vitara grid based on a particular attribute form. Open Vitara properties window by clicking on the \u201cEdit' button.  Open \u201cAdvanced Sorting\u201d menu. In the advanced sorting window we can select the attribute form on which we want to sort the grid chart.In this example I selected the attribute form \u201cCustomer First Name\u201d to sort the grid chart.If we don't want to display the attribute form on which we applied sorting we can hide that attribute form. Open \u201cShow/Hide Columns\u201d menu and uncheck the attribute form/attribute you don't want display in the chart.Below is the result of Vitara grid chart, in which we enabled two attribute forms \u201cCustomer First Name\u201d and \u201cCustomer Last Name\u201d  and the chart is sorted based on the attribute form \u201cCustomer First Name\u201d  and finally the attribute form \u201cCustomer First Name\u201d  is not showing in the chart.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideGridFeatures/sorting.html"}, {"title": "Subtotals", "body": "SubtotalsA subtotal lets you see the totals for subgroups of your report data.

We can also edit applied thresholds by clicking on the 'Edit' button.Click on 'Add' tab to apply a new threshold.Group:If grouping is applied on any row of the grid chart, we can apply a threshold on group rows/cells. Using the 'Group' field we can decide on which rows we want to apply thresholds, i.e. on individual rows or grouped rows. Select 'No grouping' to apply a threshold on normal rows or select the group row to apply a threshold on group rows.Metric:Select the metric on which you want to apply a threshold in 'Metric' drop down box.Select Target:In 'Select Target' drop down box select the type of threshold you want; a row or cell highlighter.For example, if I apply a threshold for Profit top 5 apply green color, using 'Cell' in 'Select Target', the threshold will display as shown in the below screenshot.If we apply 'Row' in the 'Select Target' drop down box the same threshold will be as shown in the below screenshot.Select Condition:When you select any threshold condition, the threshold editor window will stretch into its complete view. Below is a screenshot of the full threshold editor window.Give all the inputs in the threshold editor window.In the 'Value(s)' text input box, give appropriate input value according to the threshold condition.Using 'Background Color' we can apply colors to the background of the text.Using 'Color' we can apply colors to the text where the threshold condition is true.We can show an icon along with text, in the cells where the threshold condition is true. Select any icon from the drop-down box. Apply color for the icon using the 'Icon Color' color input tab, and assign a size to icons using the 'Select Size' text input box.We can show only in the cells where the threshold condition is true. To apply this property, enable 'Icon Only' checkbox.After all the inputs are entered click on the 'Apply' tab.Below is a screenshot of the Vitara grid chart showing the result of the above threshold on the metric - 'Profit'.If you want to apply another threshold condition on the same metric click on the 'Add' button.Threshold on 'Group By' headersPlease see the below screenshot of the Vitara grid chart, where grouping is applied on the 'Product Category' attribute. The default aggregation function applied is 'Sum'.We can also apply thresholds on these group header aggregations.

Ability to select threshold source and target. 2. Ability to apply threshold on attributes.Ability to select threshold source and target.In the new threshold editor window you can select source and target for a threshold. The source and target can any metric or attributes availabel in the grid. Basically, this feature allows you to apply threshold on metric using the values of other metric.Attribute thresholds in Grid chartFrom the 4.6.1 version of Vitara charts, we can apply thresholds using attributes.The source and target drop down boxes in the threshold editor window will list all the attributes and metrics in the chart. We can select an attribute as source and select an attribute as target then define a threshold condition. We have 'Equal to', 'Not Equal to', 'Contains', 'Not Contains', 'Starts with', 'Not Starts with', 'Ends with' and 'Not Ends with' are the attribute conditions that can be applied.Click on the 'Add' tab to apply a new threshold.

Drag an attribute with which you have to create groups into the Group dropzone.Below is the screenshot of a grid chart with 3 attributes and 2 metrics and the groups are created using the 'year' attribute.Step 2Hover onto a metric [Revenue metric in this case] for which the trendlines need to be applied so that the hamburger button will be displayed. Click on the hamburger button, then a menu will be opened.Hover the mouse onto 'Display as', then a submenu will be opened which has the trendline charts. See the screenshot below:Step 3Click on the trendline of your choice on that menu. For example, we will click on the 'Line chart' here. Then the trendlines for the 'Revenue' metric looks the below way. See the screenshot.If you have noticed the above screenshot, the 'Category' attribute got grouped automatically after applying trendlines for a metric.   This is because the trendlines are always applied for the second attribute in the chart.Unsetting the Trendlines:After applying trendlines for metrics, we can remove them using the below steps.Open the hamburger menu of the metric in which trendlines need to be removed.Hover onto 'Display as' and wait for the submenu to open.Click on the list item 'value'. See the screenshot below.Then the trendlines will be removed for that metric and value will be shown as in the screenshot attached in Step 1.Formatting the Trendlines:In Grid chart, we cannot simply apply trendlines but we can also format them. We can format the trendlines according to the type of chart applied.To go to the trendlines format window, apply trendlines for a metric and open its hamburger menu. Hover on to 'Display as' and wait for the submenu to open up. Click on 'more options'.See the screenshot.When you click on 'more options', the below window will be opened.In the above screenshot, Trend Line Options for dropdown allows you to select a metric on which you need to apply trendlines.And Chart Type dropdown allows you to select a trendline chart for a particular metric selected in the above dropdown.Let us look into chart-wise formattings1. Line ChartFor Line charts, we can format the line color and the final spot color.To start with, first apply the 'Line Chart' trendline for a metric and open the format window.Then set line color (e.g, red) and also the final spot color (e.g, blue). Click on 'Apply'.See the screenshot below with applied formattings.2. Bar ChartFor Bar charts, we can format the bar colors and negative bar colors. To start with, first apply the 'Bar Chart' trendline for a metric and open the format window.Then set Bar color (e.g, green) and negative color (e.g, red). Click on 'Apply'.See the screenshot below with applied formattings.3. Bullet ChartFor Bar charts, we can format the bar colors and negative bar colors. To start with, first apply the 'Bullet Chart' trendline for a metric and open the format window.Then set Actual color (e.g, green), Target color (e.g, red) and 3 band colors (e.g, blue, yellow and aqua). Click on 'Apply'. See the screenshot below with applied formattings.Axis SpecificityFrom the 4.5.4 release, for the line chart and bar chart as trend lines, user can select the specificity of the axis for the same. Earlier we default to using the same scale across all the rows for the same metric. Of course with this any large outliers are a problem. In the 4.5.4 release we added an optional setting to not use the same scale and show each row's trends independently.Now the customer can choose one of the option from the two,a) same scale across all the rows for the same metric:This is the default option and the minimum and maximum of the scale will be based on the minimum and maximum of that metric.b) Apply at each cell:Apply at each cell will be based on the trending minimum and maximum under a display group.In the below example the use these two options is explained in detail. As stated above, by defalut for each metric the bars hieght is set by considering minimum and maximum values from the entire metric. The least hieght of the bar corresponds to the minimum values of the metric and biggest bar corresponds to the maximum values of the metric.In the below screenshot, the category - Electronics has biggest numbers when compared to the other other categories. Therefore the hieght of the bars for other categories - Books, Movies, and Music are too small and not visible properly.The below screenshot is the vitara grid chart in which bars are set as trendlines.If we want to make hieghts of the bar in each cell (group element) independent with other cell we have to choose the option - Apply at each cell. Click on hamburger button of the metric on which you want to enable this feature.Expand the \u201cDisplay Style\u201d menu and select \u201cMore Options\u201d.Expand the Scale dropdown box and select the option - Apply at each cell and click on Apply button.By selecting this option Vitara Grid chart will consider the maximum and minimum values with in the cell (group element) of that particular metric. For example, if we consider the Cost metric, from all the bars of Books category the least value is given smallest bar hieght and the maximum value is given the biggest bar hieght.

Below is a screenshot of the 'Value Aggregation' tab.Vitara grid chart allows applying only the aggregation functions which are listed in the 'Value Aggregation' tab. The default aggregation function is 'Sum'.Choose ColumnIn the 'Value Aggregation' tab of the grid chart, there are some basic functions that can be used to apply aggregations. If we want a function other than these functions, by using the 'Choose Column' option in the 'Value Aggregation' tab we can implement it.It is possible to use aggregation from a different metric (say metric B) as the aggregation for metric A. The way to set it up is to use both metric A and metric B on the grid. Now metric B is something you would define in MicroStrategy having the right type of aggregation at the desired dimensionality. On the Vitara Grid column for metric B, you would just choose a trivial aggregation (like first or last).In the column for metric A, choose aggregation and choose a column to select metric B. Now you can just hide column for metric B if you don't want it displayed.Example:For example, in the below screenshot group by is applied at the 'Product Category' level. I want to show 'value aggregation' for profit metric as (Profit - Shipping Cost).But using the Vitara grid chart 'Value Aggregation' formulas I can't define this aggregation. The following is the procedure for defining this aggregation.Step 1:Define a derived metric using the formula we want in aggregation. Let us assume the derived metric name is 'Actual Profit'.                      Actual Profit = Profit - Shipping CostThe level at which we want this aggregation is the 'Product Category' level. Therefore, the derived metric also defined at this level. The MicroStrategy formula for this derived metric will be                      Sum ((Profit-[Shipping Cost])){[Product Category]}Step 2:Add this metric to the grid chart.Step 3:Apply aggregations like First, Last, Max or Min for 'Actual Profit' derived metric.Step 4:The derived metric 'Actual Profit' is showing exactly the same aggregation values which we want to show at the 'Profit' metric. To copy this aggregation value at 'Profit' metric, open 'Value Aggregation' for 'profit metric, go to 'Choose Column' and select the derived metric 'Actual Profit'.Step 5:Now as we defined the derived metric 'Actual Profit' for calculating value aggregation for the 'Profit' metric and we don't need this metric in our grid chart we can hide this metric. Click on the hamburger button of the 'Actual Profit' metric and select 'Hide Column'.You can verify in the below screenshot, the aggregation value of 'Profit' metric, is it showing exactly (Profit - Shipping Cost). The aggregation functions applied for 'Profit' and 'Shipping Cost' is Sum.Ratio AggregationIn the 3.9 release, Vitara Grid and Micro charts have a new aggregation function called 'Ratio'. We can implement a ratio of two metrics as aggregation in the chart.

As there are four partitions in the chart representing each country (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) in our United Kingdom countries example, there are objects named from 0 to 3.It is now evident that the shape we downloaded is exactly what we need. Our data and the coordinates in the shapefile are identical.The next step is to locate the 'dictionary key'. The dictionary key is the parameter that uniquely identifies each partition in the shape file. The United Kingdom map is divided into four sections, which should be defined with some boundary coordination. Each of these border coordinates has its own name. These distinct names are listed in the 'properties' column of each GeoJSON file partition. To find the dictionary key, expand any object, such as '0' and extend the 'properties' array.Please note the rounded area in the screenshot below.There are various fields in this properties array that can be used as dictionary keys. For instance, we can use the 'hc-a2' field as a dictionary key. The hc-a2 field value is 'EN' for England, 'WA' for Wales, 'SC' for Scotland, and 'NI' for Northern Ireland. You may have noticed that each field is distinct.The point here is that you can declare any field as a dictionary key, but it must match our data. We have nation names rather than short forms in our data file.Therefore, exact matching fields in the properties array with our data is the 'name' field.If there is no matching dictionary key field in shapefile with data file, we must generate synonyms. This is covered in the section 'Dictionary property' of the document titled 'Customization of the Map chart'.After determining the dictionary key, we can create a new map layer for our example. For this, change the'mappinglayers.txt' file, which is located in the Vitara map chart installation folder at the following path.C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Tomcat 8.0\\webapps\\MicroStrategy \\plugins\\VitaraMaps\\customThe following is the screenshot of 'mappingLayers.txt' file. There are three predefined mapping layers, world physical, US physical, and US Countries.The following is the notation to add new map layer:  <ns>.<property><ns>: NameSpace, this can be any combination of alphabets, but choose a unique value for each new map layer.The map layer should contain the following properties;<ns>.name =<ns>.shape =<ns>.dictionarykey =In the 'name' property we define the name of the map we want to give.For example, i want to give 'United Kingdom' as the name, then 'name' property definition will bekk.name= United KingdomIn the shape property definition we should give the path where we copied the shape file of our map.For our example, as we copied the shape file into VitaraMaps\\custom\\shapes folder, the following is the shape property definition.kk.shape= custom/shapes/uk-countries.geoAll the shape files should be placed in 'Shapes' folder in custom folder. This is not compulsory, but in the naming convention point of view it's better to do.Dictionary key property definition will be the unique identity field we selected in GeoJSON shapefile.kk.dictionarykey = nameIn the mapping layers text file start a new map definition and define name, shape, dictionary key properties.(please refer section 'Mapping layers text file' in the document titled 'Customization of the Map chart'for more information about 'mapping layers text file)kk.name= United Kingdomkk.shape= custom/shapes/uk-countries.geokk.dictionarykey= namePlease refer the sections 'Name' property, 'Shape' property, 'Dictionary key' property and Dictionary' property in the document titled 'Customization of the Map chart' to know the procedure how to define these properties. After defining all these properties save 'Mapping layers' text file.The following is the screenshot of mappingLayes.txt file after defining United Kingdom mapping layer.Now, in MicroStrategy, create a dossier or RS document and insert the Vitara map chart. The 'World Physical' map is displayed by default in Vitara Map. Select the'map' tab after clicking the 'edit' button. The 'Map Layer' drop down button should be expanded. The updated map definition 'United Kingdom' can be found here. Choose this map layer. Please see the screenshot below.Apply required Map attribute and a metric to the visualization.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideMapFeatures/creatingNewMaps.html"}, {"title": "Custom Layouts", "body": "Creating Custom Map chart from ImagesCustom layouts are created using the Vitara Map tool. This tool works in the same way as the other SVG drawing tools.The advantage of using this tool is that it now allows you to complete the process of designing and setting a custom Vitara map in a single tool. That is, you will be creating a shape file, setting groups, and configuring all related mappings all at once.It could be any geographical map that depicts a location, or it could be a map of a shopping mall that depicts several product sectors such as children's apparel, menswear, groceries, and so on.As an example, consider a football stadium. We want the Vitara map chart in a football stadium to reflect the availability of seats in various seating zones.Assuming the data is already available, we'll use the dataset's attribute to label the layouts. For example, we used sections as attributes and metrics as the percentage of available seats.Check out the following dataset for an example of how we prepared it in the manner described above:1. Steps to Create SVG file from an Image:Step 1:Any SVG drawing tool is necessary to create an SVG file for a custom map. The page's URL, where the layout creation tool may be found, is listed below. Open your browser and enter this URL. Vitara Map Tool Step 2:When the tool is first opened, it looks like this.Step 3:Upload your own original image to the layout design tool if you want to use the Vitara map chart with your own custom image. To upload a custom image, go to the File menu and click Import Image. As an example, consider a football stadium. We want the Vitara map chart in a football stadium to reflect the availability of seats in various seating zones.Step 4:After the image has been uploaded, start drawing shapes/partitions on the image using the path tool.Nodes can be removed and added if you make any mistakes.Step 5:When you begin sketching a shape/partition, at the end of the shape you link to the starting point, the entire shape is highlighted, and the text input box is visible in the right side panel. In this box, type the name of the form you just drew.For example, Section 219 is the name we gave to the layout based on an attribute we already had in the dataset.Step 6:To distinguish the above-drawn area from other lines, locate the 'Color\u00a0Bar' in the lower left corner of the editor (click the text None to bring up the Fill and Stroke dialogue). Choose a\u00a0color\u00a0that you like.Step 7:Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7 to create forms for all of the portions required. In this situation, the boundaries of the two shapes must line so that when we zoom in, we don't see borders that are close but not on top of each other. This is ensured by selecting the Snap to path button in the right toolbar.Step 8:After we have labelled all of the layers, we must name the background picture in order to export it (the background image label can be anything irrespective of the image), and then download the layout using the Export option.Give a name to your layout. The file will be downloaded as a zip file.2. Configure VitaraMaps folderStep 1:Finally, upload the exported zip file to your MicroStrategy server's\u00a0Vitara Maps\u00a0chart deployment. For example, the MicroStrategy web application path where you must copy the zip file is shown below.      webapps/MicroStrategy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/svgmaps/If you're using library and mobile apps as well, then you'll need to copy into the library and mobile deployment directories as well.      webapps/MicroStrategyLibrary/plugins/VitaraMapsLibrary/custom/svgmaps/      webapps/MicroStrategyMobile/plugins/VitaraMapsMobile/custom/svgmaps/After copying at the above location, unzip it.The custom map, for example Stadium, will then appear in the 'Map' tab of the property editor. Take a look at the image below for an example.Step 2:Launch Microstrategy web. Create  Vitara map visualization in a dossier or document. The Vitara map visualisation defaults to a world map.Drag the 'Section' attribute in map attribute and the 'Availability%' attribute in Colour by to include the dataset you mentioned at the beginning.When the pointer is over the visualisation, the 'Edit' button appears. By pressing the 'Edit' button, you can access the Vitara map chart's property editor. Select the 'Map' menu in the properties window. Select the map layer you just created from the 'Map Layer' drop down list box.If everything goes as planned, the finished result will look like this.Integration of BackgroundWe implemented a new functionality that enables us to integrate background images starting with version 4.9.2.477. We've used the \u201cStadium\u201d example once more to illustrate this point; the processes for creating a custom map chart from photos are the same as those previously.When a picture is uploaded and specific shapes are drawn in the new layout creation tool ( Vitara Map Tool ), the complete image can be seen in the Vitara\u00a0map chart. Earlier, you could only see the shapes you had drawn on the picture.But now , from version 4.9.2.477 background image can be integrated.Color Picker with OpacityFrom version 5.0.0.484 , we have the option to adjust the slider to change the opacity of the desired class.Edit Custom SVG MapOnce you've generated a Custom SVG map layout and need to make changes to it, follow the steps below:An SVG image will be included in every exported Custom SVG map zip file. Use the Vitara Map Tool to open it in the manner outlined below.Re-export the zip file after making the necessary modifications to the SVG layout.Extract the zip file to the MicroStrategy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/svgmaps/ folder after uploading it to the server. The Property editor will display the updated map so you can view the changes.Adding Custom SVG to workstationIn Version 5.1.1.495, we included a new option for adding Custom SVG to workstations.When the workstation is not connected to the server and we want to generate a new custom SVG map, we must deploy the build locally and unzip the downloaded zip file in the 'svgmaps' folder that we acquired from Vitara Map Tool (URL). Below I have taken 'Hospital.zip' as an example,Following the above-mentioned step, a text box will open in the property editor under the Map's tab where we must input the Custom SVG name in the text field, which would be case-sensitive \u201cCustom Map name,\u201d and enable/check  the \u201cLoad Custom Map\u201d option.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideMapFeatures/customLayouts.html"}, {"title": "Customization of the Map chart", "body": "Customization of Map chart (Creating maps other than default maps)Common customization usage cases:Changes from the default ISO country names/codes: For example, the nation name - USA - can be written in a variety of ways, including US, United States, America, United States of America, and so on. Deviations from ISO-a2 standard names/codes can be corrected by adding synonyms to the dictionary file. (For constructing synonyms, please see the dictionary property section.)** A different world map projection is required, or the customer wants certain alternative shapes of maps, such as retail layouts or hotel layouts that show occupancy, and so on.**To create custom maps, the user must understand the following terms. First, tell us about the files in the map chart folder. When you unzip the vitara map chart plugin, you will see the following folders: custom, data, javascript, style, and WEB-INF.It is recommended that users use the \u201ccustom\u201d folder to generate or save any files when creating custom charts. There are two crucial subfolders in the 'custom' folder: dictionaries and shapes. A text file called'mapping layers' is also included in the 'custom' folder. All mapping layers are loaded into this root file form.The path to the custom folder in your vitara map chart installation is shown below. tomcat/webapps/MicroStratagy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/The following section will explain the use of 'dictionaries' folder, 'shapes' folder, and 'mapping layers' text file.Mapping layers text file:The following is the screenshot of mapping layers text file which will be in the following path tomcat/webapps/MicroStratagy/plugins/VitaraMaps/custom/'Map layer' refers to a map in a vitara map chart. In the vitara map chart, for example, there are three preset maps. A map layer must be defined for each of these maps. There are three definitions of map layers in the mapping layers text file: world physical, US Physical, and US Counties.To add a new map layer, use the notation <ns>.property.<ns>: NameSpace, which can be any alphabetic combination, but must be unique for each new map layer. The map layer should have the following attributes:<ns>.name =<ns>.shape =<ns>.dictionarykey =<ns>. dictionary =<ns>.groups =The 'groups' definition is optional.Name Property:It's the name we'd want to give our map. For example, if I want to make a map that shows the human population for each continent and name it 'world\u00a0continents,' the name property definition would be as follows:kk.name = World ContinentsNow, by using this name we can create a map which shows world continents. You can see this name in edit popup window \u2192 Map \u2192 Map Layer.Shape property:This file is in geojson (.json) format.This file contains information on the borders of areas on a map. The needed shape file can be downloaded from online resources or produced using various applications. Download geojson shape-files from this link: http://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/The shape file for our global continent example can be downloaded straight from the URL below. http://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/custom/world-continents.geo.jsonA shape file with the name \u201cworld-continents.geo\u201d (.geo.json extension) will be obtained by clicking on the preceding link. The downloaded file should be placed in the following directory. VitaraMaps\\custom\\shapesThe path where we copied our map's shape file should be specified in the shape property specification.The shape property definition for globe continents is as follows, as we copied the shape file into VitaraMapscustomshapes folder.custom/shapes/world-continents.geo.json = kk.shapeAll shape files should be saved in the 'Shapes' folder of the custom folder. This is not required, however it is preferable in terms of naming convention.'Dictionary key' Property:The word 'dictionary key' refers to the unique name assigned to each map division. In the world's continents example, there might be six partitions in the map representing each continent: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America (excluding Antarctica, which has no human inhabitants). Each partition should now have a distinct name by which it may be identified. These distinct names are specified in the shape file.Open the downloaded shapefile \u201cworld-continents.geo\u201d in any text editor, such as notepad, for our world continents example. Make a copy of the whole contents of this file.Use any online json reader, such as http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/, to open the shapefile in json structure.Now in the notepad copy the entire content of shapefile (.geo.json) and paste it in the \u201cText\u201d tab of json viewer webpage. Now click on \u201cViewer\u201d tab in json viewer webpage.Now the geojson content will be displayed in json tree structure.One of the objects in the json tree structure is the 'features' array. We have objects for each segment of the chart if we expand the 'features' array. In our world continents example, there are objects numbered 0 to 5 because there are six partitions in the chart representing each continent (except Antarctica)..Now expand any object, for example '0'.Expand 'properties' in '0' object.A few fields define a unique name for each partition of the map chart. We can use the name that fits our data as a 'dictionary key'. For instance, I have the following data in which continents are represented by names.For this use case i have to use 'name' as dictionary key. Please refer the below screenshot.For our world continents example, the following will be the dictionary key definition.Kk.dictionarykey = name'Dictionary' property:To know about this property lets take a look at our world continents map data excel file.Take a look at the 'Australia' continent. Let's compare this to the shapefile and look for unique names linked with each map segment.Except for Australia, which is named \u201cOceania\u201d in shape file, the names of the continents in our data and the unique names in shapefile by which each area of the globe is defined are the same. As a result, Map chart does not\u00a0recognize\u00a0the word 'Australia' in our data file. The map chart displays the partitions in the shapefile. However, because this partition does not match the name we are calling in our data file, it does not display any data in the map chart. Please see the marked region in the screenshot below.Similarly, if the data differs from the unique names in the shapefile, or if the shapefile only contains ISO-a2 codes and our data has names for these codes, we have created a text that\u00a0lists' synonyms' for the names in the shapefile and the names in the data. Let us make a synonym for our example: World continent. We must match the name in the shapefile - \u201cOceania\u201d - with the name in the data, \u201cAustralia.\u201d 'Australia' has replaced 'Oceania' as a synonym. All of the synonyms must be listed in a text file in this manner.I created a text file with name 'worldcontinents' and entered the synonym 'Oceania = Australia', and saved this file in VitaraMaps \u2192 custom \u2192 dictionaries folder.We can list multiple synonyms also. Multiple synonyms should be comma separated.For example, US = United States, United States of America, America, USANow the dictionary property definition in mapping layer text file tells about the path of the synonyms text file where we saved it.For our example the property definition is:Kk.dictionary = custom/dictionaries/worldcontinents.txtAll such dictionaries files should be saved in 'dictionaries' folder in custom folder. This is not compulsory, but in the naming convention point of view it's better to do.As we added the synonym for 'Oceania' the map chart now shows the synonym i.e. 'Australia'. Please refer the circled area in the below screenshot.Till now, we had created all the property definitions for our example, world continents map, in mapping layers text file.kk.name = World Continentskk.shape = custom/shapes/world-continents.geo.jsonkk.dictionarykey = ios-a2kk.dictionary = custom/dictionaries/worldcontinents.txtSave the mapping layers text file. Below is the screenshot of 'mappingLayers' text file after adding 'worldcontinents' map layer.After saving mapping layers file, refresh your web browser. Once the map chart renders, go to Edit \u2192 Map \u2192 Expand - Map Layers, and apply the map which you created.The below screenshot is the output of map chart, showing population in each continent.Likewise other world map projections can be downloaded from the links provided below.Reference link to download geojson shapefiles:http://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/Reference link to convert existing ESRI maps to geojson filehttps://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-geojsonOthers:http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http://geojson.io/http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html'Groups' Property:The primary purpose of the grouping option is to make it easier to group individual regions on the map as a single unit, as opposed to regions with a single boundary. Vitara Map\u00a0chart will draw any map for the regions given in the shapefile by default. For example, in the screenshot below, the\u00a0Vitara Map\u00a0chart displays a map of the world's countries. We must\u00a0utilize\u00a0the world countries shapefile to create this map. As a result, by default, this map graphic will accept data at the country level.To build this map at a higher level, for example, countries\u00a0organizations\u00a0such as NATO, BRICS, and so on, we must enable 'Grouping' in the\u00a0Vitara Map\u00a0chart. A screenshot of a sample data file with both country and\u00a0organization\u00a0columns is shown below.To show the data in Vitara Map chart at which level, we must add that attribute to the \u201cMap Attribute\u201d drop zone. If we add the 'Country' attribute, the map will display data by country, and if we add the 'Organization' attribute, the chart will display data at this level.Because we used a shapefile with nation information in the preceding example, the\u00a0Vitara map\u00a0chart will display country level data by default. However, if we wish to display the data at a higher level, we must use the 'Grouping' property.To group separate regions, we must first construct a text file that lists all of the distinct regions. The following is the format for defining a group: Group name = List of individual areas in comma separated format.Save this text file in the custom folder's 'dictionaries' folder. The screenshot below is of a group text file that I made. In our example, I named the group file 'NATOBRICSgroups.txt'.The next step is defining 'groups' property in 'MappingLayers' file. In groups property we have give the path of groups text file where we saved it.wp.groups = custom/dictionaries/NATOBRICSgroups.txtThe following is the screenshot of 'MappingLayers' file after adding groups property.The last step to apply groups in vitara map chart is, enable Grouping\u201d option under Map menu in property editor. (Edit \u2192  MAP \u2192 Enable Grouping). Screenshot is provided below for reference.The outcome of grouping in the globe physical map is shown below. When we move the mouse over any of the grouping regions, all of the items in the group and all of the regions will appear in a single\u00a0color.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideMapFeatures/customizingMapChart.html"}, {"title": "Default Maps", "body": "Default Maps in Vitara Map ChartThe default charts in Vitara Maps Chart installation are World Physical, US Physical, and US counties. The charts list can be enlarged by adding additional nations or picture shapes, as explained in the next sections.Vitara Map Chart Inputs:Vitara Map\u00a0is a heatmap. The map regions are\u00a0color\u00a0coded depending on a single metric. The required inputs are described in the next section.1. Attributes: One attribute. We may use the world physical map without any adjustments if the attribute components contain either ISO-standard country names or ISO-a2 country codes. The screenshot below is from a website where we may obtain country ISO-A2 codes.If there is a mismatch between the nation names in our data and the country names in the shape file, we must add synonyms. This notion is covered in the 'Mapping layers' chapter.The attribute should contain the names of US states for the US Physical map.2. Metrics: A minimum of one measure is required to create a map chart. Drag a metric into the 'Color By' drop zone. In this drop zone, any metric at the map area level can be used to generate the\u00a0Heatmap. We can add as many metrics as we want to the 'tooltip' drop zone. These metrics will not be used in map\u00a0plotting but\u00a0will be displayed in a tooltip when we hover the cursor over the map.The following sections will explain about the three vitara default maps.Default Maps in Vitara Map Chart1. World Physical:Consider the population density of the five countries listed below: the United States, the Russian Federation, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The data file is shown in the screenshot below.Insert the data file into the MicroStrategy dashboard or document. Drag and drop the country name attribute and Population Density metrics into the drop zone field's 'Map Attribute' and 'color\u00a0by' fields, respectively. These nations will be displayed on the default global physical map.The below screenshot is the Vitara map chart showing Population density for all the countries.2. U.S. Physical map:To illustrate this chart, consider net migration from 2014 to 2015 for the five states of Washington, Arizona, California, Florida, and New York.Insert the dataset into MicroStrategy's web or desktop client. Drag the attributes and metrics into the drop zone. By default, the Vitara map chart will display a physical map of the world. Click the 'Edit' button to set it to US Physical. The Properties window will appear. Go to the 'Map' menu, expand the 'Map Layer' tab, and then pick US Physical. The output of the US Physical map is seen in the screenshot below.3. U.S. Counties:By default chart will show 'World Physical\u201d map. Go to 'Edit' and change the map layer to 'US Counties' map. The following screenshot is from the example data for counties in US.The below screenshot is output of the 'US Counties' map.ThresholdsThe maps will draw gradient thresholds by default. Gradient thresholds with the required number of stops are applied between two\u00a0colors. Gradient thresholds are applied to Metrics with the Start and End\u00a0colors\u00a0based on the Target and Source choices.Click on the Edit Button\u2192 Thresholds Button\u2192 We can set Gradient Thresholds through conditions.From version 5.0.0.484 , we have the option to adjust the slider to change the opacity of the desired class.Examples for Gradient Threshold:In the below screenshot, for the Vitara maps, we applied the Gradient threshold on Background Bar, and Red as Start color and Green as End color, with 5 Stops. Apply all the inputs and click on 'Apply' button.Note: From 4.6 version we can apply thresholds using attributes. The source drop down box in the threshold editor window will list all the attributes and metrics in the chart. We can select an attribute as source and define a threshold condition. The target of the threshold depends on the metrics in the chart. In this case we can set threshold using attribute. The attribute threshold conditions are listed as 'Equal to', 'Not equal to', 'Contains', 'Not Contains', 'Starts with', 'Not Starts with', 'Ends with', and 'Not Ends with' in these types.Below is the screenshots how to apply attribute thresholds using property editor. Set target as '2016' year and source as 'State Name' and select condition as 'Starts with' and enter the value 'M' and color as 'blue'. Apply all the inputs and click on 'Apply' button.Below is the screenshot after applying the attribute threshold condition 'Starts with' with value 'Missouri'.Here's an other example, where 'State Name' contains 'a' and with color 'Yellow'.", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/guideMapFeatures/defaultMaps.html"}, {"title": "Formatting Options", "body": "Formatting Options in Vitara Map ChartVitara Maps\u00a0includes an infinite number of formatting possibilities.

They are global.txt and customStyles.css.The CSS class names and properties will be added to the customStyles.ccs file. Consult the sections 1 through 6 above to learn more about CSS classes and properties.Themes will be listed in the global.txt file in order to make them visible in the property editor.Step 1:For example, if we have to create a theme named 'theme1' which styles even and odd rows of the grid chart. Then in customStyles.css file, the format of CSS code should be as.Theme1 .vitara-row.vitara-grid-row-even{    color:white;    background-color: lightseagreen;    font-size:12px;    font-family:verdana;}.Theme1 .vitara-row.vitara-grid-row-odd{    color:wheat;    background-color:teal;    font-family:helvetica;    font-size:12px;}The name of the theme is Theme1 in the code above.And, as you may have noticed, the theme name 'Theme1' is repeated, that is, the name appears in both the first and second pieces of code.According to the feature, the theme name should be repeated as many times as there are code blocks in order for certain styles to be applied solely to a single theme.Let's make another theme that styles all of the rows and header cells. Also, the format should be as follows:.Theme2 .vitara-row{    color:blue;     background-color:lightblue !important;    font-family:calibri;    font-size:14px; }.Theme2 .vitara-header.vitara-grid-header-cell {color:brown;font-size:15px;font-family:calibri;font-weight: bold;background-color:pink;}And in the above blocks of CSS code also, the theme name Theme2 is repeated.Step 2:Now, add those theme names to the global.txt file in the way shown below. Please keep in mind that theme names are case sensitive. As a result, the names should be the same as they are in customStyles.css.gridThemes.themes=Theme1,Theme2The themes will then be listed in the grid chart. This can be verified in two ways: one using the property editor and the other through the context menu [2020]. Please see the screenshots below.Property EditorContext menuStep 3:Now, apply Theme1 from either the property editor or context menu. Then the charts like below screenshot.And apply Theme2. Then the chart looks like the screenshot below.Base ThemesThe base theme is the one to which custom theme styles are applied. A custom theme is always applied to a base theme.For example, we have a grid chart with the subject 'Blue'. And now, when we apply a custom theme, the styles are applied to a white-based theme rather than a blue-based theme. This is due to the fact that all custom themes are by default based on the white theme.The grid chart saved with the 'Blue' theme is shown below in a screenshot.After applying the custom theme 'theme1', the base theme gets changed to white. See the colors of headers and group dropzones in the below screenshot.Changing the base theme:The basic theme for custom themes can also be changed. The starting point might be an in-built theme or any customised theme. For example, if we want the default theme to be 'Dark,' add the following line to the global.txt file.gridThemes.baseThemes=DarkApply the custom theme 'Theme1' now, and the styles will be applied to the 'Dark' base theme. Compare the screenshot below to the previous screenshot.Setting default themeWe can now set the Grid chart's default theme as of Vitara Charts version 4.5. A built-in theme or a custom theme can be used as the default theme. For instance, if we want to make 'Theme2' a custom theme as the default theme, we would add the following to the global.txt file.gridThemes.defaultTheme=Theme2", "url": "https://docs.vitaracharts.com/customization/GridCustomCSS.html"}, {"title": "Introduction", "body": "Please note that several of these features (linked to on the left) require a specific version (or higher) of VitaraCharts.

For instance, \u201c\u201cFrutiger 45 Light.\u201dStep 6:In src:url line copy the path of the folder in which we copied the font file.In the below example Hokjesgeest font is deployed.@font-face {            font-family: Hokjesgeest;            src: url(../style/v430559/font/Hokjesgeest.ttf);           }Another example which has spaces in the font name:@font-face {            font-family: \"Frutiger 45 Light\";            src: url(\"../style/v430559/font/Frutiger 45 Light.ttf\");           }Step 7:If you want to add multiple custom fonts, then define font family for each custom font.@font-face {            font-family: fontello;            src: url(../style/v430559/font/fontello.ttf);           }Step 8:List all the custom fonts names in the font vitara-chart-container..vitara .vitara-chart-container{font-family:Hokjesgeest, fontello, \"Frutiger 45 Light\", Arial, Helvetica,Verdana, sans-serif !important;}Below is the screenshot of the updated \u201ccustomStyle.css\u201d file.Steps to show the custom fonts in the font-family dropdowns in property editor and set a particular font as default font.Step 1:Open the file named global.txt in the following path,Tomcat 8.0\\webapps\\MicroStrategy\\plugins\\VitaraCharts\\customIn this file, you can find fields named font.customFonts and font.defaultFontStep 2:Include all the custom fonts specified in the font.customFonts key, each one separated by a comma (,).For example,font.customFonts=OpenSans, Hokjesgeest, Frutiger 45 LightStep 3 (Custom font by default across all charts):To set a font as default font for all charts, set the font.defaultFont key.For example,font.defaultFont=Hokjesgeestorfont.defaultFont=Frutiger 45 LightRefresh your web browser and open Vitara Charts.

Vitara charts will display this 'Edit' option when the user hovers the cursor over any of the charts.

Vitaracharts can be configured using the security model so that only developers or document designers, not end users, can change the Vitara charts. Depending on the privileges or file permissions that a user has in MicroStrategy, we can allow or limit a user from editing or modifying Vitara charts.Disable edit button using User Privileges:The privilege and permission settings in Vitara Charts are configured in the 'global.txt' file, which is located in the Vitara Charts installation folder. In general, it will take the following path:Tomcat 8.0\\webapps\\MicroStrategy\\plugins\\VitaraCharts\\custom.In the 'global.txt' file, the code \u201c#checkPrivilegeForPropertiesEditor=125\u201d will handle user privileges. In this line, we must specify the DSSXML Privilege value of the privilege on which we want to impose a security requirement. The DSSXML Privilege value of 'Web Document Design' is 125 by default. Uncomment this line by removing the '#' to establish the criteria 'Web Document Design' using user privilege. Only users with the 'Web Document Design' privilege will now be able to edit all Vitara charts. You can also use additional privileges to set this requirement. The DSSXML permission value for the 'Web Print Mode' permission, for example, is 27. In the privilege settings line, enter these values.checkPrivilegeForPropertiesEditor=27 The users with this privilege enabled are only able to edit or modify Vitaracharts.Disable edit button using File Permissions:Vitara Charts will inherit a user's file permissions on a specific report services document and display the 'Edit' button if they match the permissions provided in the global.txt file. The following code will deal with setting security conditions applying file permissions in the 'global.txt' file.#accessControlLevels=read/writeThis line will be commented by default. Remove the '#' character to uncomment this line.
